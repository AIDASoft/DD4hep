DDG4: The digitization tools of DD4hep
========================================

Simulating the detector response is an essential tool in high energy physics
to analyze the sensitivity of an experiment to the underlying physics.
Such simulation tools require a detailed though convenient detector description as 
it is provided by the `DD4hep` toolkit `DDG4` which uses [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/)
to simulate the energy response of a given apparatus.
The toolkit implements a modular and flexible approach to simulation activities using `Geant4`.
User defined simulation applications using `DDG4` can easily be configured, 
extended using specialized action routines.

The design is strongly driven by easy of use;
developers of detector descriptions and applications using
them should provide minimal information and minimal specific
code to achieve the desired result.
