DD4hep is a software framework for providing a complete solution for full detector description (geometry, materials, visualization, readout, alignment, calibration, etc.) for the full experiment life cycle (detector concept development, detector optimization, construction, operation). It offers a consistent description through a single source of detector information for simulation, reconstruction, analysis, etc. It distributed under the [LGPLv3 License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)
