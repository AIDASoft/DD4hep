This is an example how to implement a specialized sensitive detector in DDG4.
The sensitive detector is called MyTrackerSD.
As a hit class it uses the Geant4TrackerHit class.

1) The example should illustrate how to setup the factory for a specialized sensitive detector action
2) In the scripts area there is a simple example to illustrate how to setup a small
   simulation and use this factory. (scripts/MyTrackerSD_sim.py)
