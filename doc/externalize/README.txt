dd4hep externalizations
=======================

From time to time is is useful to import some pieces of other frameworks in new projects.
dd4hep has currently the following components, which can be used also standalone outside:

- The XML parsing framework including the expression evaluator.
- The property mechanism uing the boost::spirit parsers.

The two scripts internally show which files are required to be imported in other
projects.


For details, and in the event of problems, please contact me.
