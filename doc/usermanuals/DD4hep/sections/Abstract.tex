\noindent
The detector description is an essential component that is used to analyze data
resulting from particle collisions in high energy physics experiments.
We will present a generic detector description toolkit
and describe the guiding requirements and the architectural design for
such a toolkit, as well as the main implementation choices.
The design is strongly driven by easy of use;
developers of detector descriptions and applications using
them should provide minimal information and minimal specific
code to achieve the desired result.
The toolkit will be built reusing already existing components
from the ROOT geometry package and provides missing functional
elements and interfaces to offer a complete and coherent
detector description solution. A natural integration to
Geant4, the detector simulation program used in high energy physics,
is provided.
