* 2022-07-19 Markus Frank ([PR#933](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/933))
  The fast simulation handling in Geant4 includes the GFlash interface
  as implemented in `<geant40-source>/source/parameterisations/gflash`
  and a fast simulation interface as provided by 
  `<geant40-source>/source/processes/parameterisation`
  
  This MR allows to handle both mechanisms using the same callbacks 
  in the Geant4SensitiveActions using the callback specialization:
  ```
        /// GFLASH/FastSim interface: Method for generating hit(s) using the information of the fast simulation spot object.
        virtual bool processFastSim(const Geant4FastSimSpot* spot, G4TouchableHistory* history)  final;
  ```
  in addition to the regular callback for full simulation:
  ```
        /// G4VSensitiveDetector interface: Method for generating hit(s) using the G4Step object.
        virtual bool process(const G4Step* step,G4TouchableHistory* history)  final;
  ```
  The `Geant4FastSimSpot` is inspired by the `G4GFlashSpot`, but avoids the specialization towards GFlash
  given that the `G4FastHit` and the `G4GFlashEnergySpot` are equivalent.
  Together with the helper class `Geant4FastSimHandler` simple sensitive detector callbacks
  can be implemented like:
  ```
      /// GFlash/FastSim interface: Method for generating hit(s) using the information of Geant4FastSimSpot object.
      template <> bool
      Geant4SensitiveAction<Geant4Tracker>::processFastSim(const Geant4FastSimSpot* spot,
  							 G4TouchableHistory* /* hist */)
      {
        typedef Geant4Tracker::Hit Hit;
        Geant4FastSimHandler h(spot);
        Hit* hit = new Hit(h.trkID(), h.trkPdgID(), h.deposit(), h.track->GetGlobalTime());
        hit->cellID        = cellID(h.touchable(), h.avgPositionG4());
        hit->energyDeposit = h.deposit();
        hit->position      = h.avgPosition();
        hit->momentum      = h.momentum();
        hit->length        = 0e0;
        collection(m_collectionID)->add(hit);
        return true;
      }
  ```
  Callbacks with this signature are called both for GFlash and the G4 fast simulation.
  
  To simplify the user defined construction of fast simulation shower models
  the helper class `Geant4FastSimShowerModel` is implemented as a `Geant4Action`
  and hence allows to have options to be set by the user (including python).
  
  As an illustration two fast simulation shower models were implemented in
  `<dd4hep>/DDG4/plugins/Geant4P1ShowerModel.cpp` which were directly deduced
  from the Geant4 example `<geant4-source>/examples/extended/parameterisations/Par01`.
  Please see the source files for details.
  
  To execute GFlash or fast simulation to simple python examples are provided
  using simple silicon blocks as sensitive volumes:
  - GFlash `<dd4hep-dir>/examples/ClientTests/scripts/SiliconBlockGFlash.py`
  - Fast simulation `<dd4hep-dir>/examples/ClientTests/scripts/SiliconBlockFastSim.py`
  
  To enable either the following actions are required:
  1. Enable fast simulation for certain particles in the physics list:
  ```  # Build the physics list:
    phys = geant4.setupPhysics('FTFP_BERT')
    ph = DDG4.PhysicsList(kernel, str('Geant4FastPhysics/FastPhysicsList'))
    ph.EnabledParticles = ['e+', 'e-']
    ph.enableUI()
    phys.adopt(ph)
  ```
  This step is identical for GFlash and fast simulation physics.
  2. Enable the shower mode:
  ```  model = DDG4.DetectorConstruction(kernel, str('Geant4Par01EMShowerModel/ShowerModel'))
    # Mandatory model parameters
    model.RegionName = 'SiRegion'
    model.Material = 'Silicon'
    model.ApplicableParticles = ['e+', 'e-']
    model.Etrigger = {'e+': 0.1 * GeV, 'e-': 0.1 * GeV}
    model.Enable = True
    model.enableUI()
  ```
  Here the options must be set according to the parameters required by the shower models.
  
  The G4 fast simulation interface is only functional for Geant4 version >= 10.07.
  For lower versions of Geant4 missing classes are stubbed to allow the compilation.

  - First attempt to implement GFlash parametrization for DDG4
  - Example is in examples/ClientTests/scripts/SiliconBlockGFlash.py
    Relevant code changes are for the detector construction:
    ```
    seq, act = geant4.addDetectorConstruction('Geant4DetectorGeometryConstruction/ConstructGeo')
    ....
    # Enable GFlash shower model
    model = DDG4.DetectorConstruction(kernel, str('Geant4GFlashShowerModel/ShowerModel'))
    model.Parametrization = 'GFlashHomoShowerParameterisation'
    # Mandatory model parameters
    model.RegionName = 'SiRegion'
    model.Material = 'Silicon'
    model.Enable = True
    # Energy boundaries are optional
    model.Emin  = {'e+': 0.1*GeV, 'e-': 0.1*GeV }  # Units in GeV
    model.Ekill = {'e+': 0.1*MeV, 'e-': 0.1*MeV }
    model.enableUI()
    seq.adopt(model)
    ```
    and the physics list.
    ```
    # Now build the physics list:
    phys = geant4.setupPhysics('FTFP_BERT')
    ph = DDG4.PhysicsList(kernel, str('Geant4FastPhysics/FastPhysicsList'))
    ph.EnabledParticles = ['e+', 'e-']
    ph.BeVerbose = True
    ph.enableUI()
    phys.adopt(ph)
    ```
  The setup of the regions is crucial for GFlash to work, because it applies to regions.
  For concrete detector constructors the proper regional setting are mandatory, but do not affect
  this implementation.

  Easy possibility to store condition payloads as std::any.
  - Use of specialized handle class `dd4hep::ConditionAny` to support the functionality.
    The payload is automatically bound to an object of type std::any.
    Example code of constructor and how to access data:
     ```
    /// Emplacement construction
    std::vector<int> value;
    ... // fill data
    ConditionAny c2("name", "type", std::move(value));
  
    /// Construct conditions object with empty std::any	 
    ConditionAny c2("name", "type");
    /// Assign data (empty vector<int>) to the payload:
    c2.get() = vector<int>();
  
    /// Access data:
    vector<int>& data = c2.as<vector<int> >();
       ```
     as a corollary to this approach these conditions can only be stored and retrieved from ROOT storage 
     if the requirement for ROOT are satisfied. Otherwise no other restrictions are imposed. 
     The corresponding grammar instance is part of the library.
  
  - Add example to illustrate the functionality in example/conditions:
     o   examples/Conditions/src/ConditionAnyExampleObjects.cpp
     o   examples/Conditions/src/ConditionAnyExampleObjects.h
     o   plugin: examples/Conditions/src/ConditionAnyExample_populate.cpp
         Invocation:
  ```
     $> geoPluginRun  -destroy -plugin DD4hep_ConditionAnyExample_populate \
          -input ../../DD4hep/examples/AlignDet/compact/Telescope.xml -iovs 1
     ```
  
  - Plugin example to test basic functionality and verify proper assignment works
     o   examples/Conditions/src/Conditions_any_basic.cpp
         Invocation:
  ```
  $> geoPluginRun -destroy -volmgr -plugin DD4hep_Conditions_any_basic
  
  ```
  - Add 2 tests illustrating this functionality.

  The python file is only there to show that the G4 simulation does not get screwed.....
  Otherwise: to define properties, which do not participate in Geant4:
  ```
      <material name="Water">
        <D type="density" value="1.0" unit="g/cm3"/>
        <composite n="2" ref="H"/>
        <composite n="1" ref="O"/>
        <!-- Properties used by Geant4    -->
        <property name="RINDEX"        ref="RINDEX__0x123aff00"/>
        <property name="ABSLENGTH"     ref="ABSLENGTH__0x123aff00"/>
        <property name="FASTCOMPONENT" ref="FASTCOMPONENT__0x123aff00"/>
        <property name="SLOWCOMPONENT" ref="SLOWCOMPONENT__0x123aff00"/>
        <!-- Properties ignored by Geant4 -->
        <property name="Property_of_mine" ref="Water__0x123aff00"/>
        <constant name="BirksConstant"    ref="Birk__Water|Geant4-ignore"/>
        <!-- Constants  ignored by Geant4 -->
        <constant name="Constant_of_mine" ref="Water__Mine|Geant4-ignore"/>
      </material>
  ```
  where:
  ```
    <properties>
      <constant name="Birk__Water|Geant4-ignore" value="12.345678"/>
      <constant name="Water__Mine|Geant4-ignore" value="87.654321"/>
    </properties>
  ```
  and
  ```
      <matrix name= "Water__0x123aff00" option="Geant4-ignore" coldim="1" values="  
                2.034*eV 
                2.068*eV 
                2.103*eV 
                2.139*eV 
                2.177*eV 
                2.216*eV 
      "/>
    </properties>
  ```
  For non-const properties you have to set the option to "Geant4-ignore",
  otherwise you append the string to the name. The "ref" string in the material
  and the property must match.
  In the program you can then access the propertiers by name like this:
  ```
  Material material(...)
  double v = material->GetConstProperty("BirksConstant");
  TGDMLMatrix* m = material->GetProperty("Property_of_mine");
  ```
  like any other property. See for details:

  - Rework the EDM4hep output action. The major reason is the renaming of the default types in AIDASoft/podio#205 and its effects on EDM4hep (key4hep/EDM4hep#132). These changes are:
    - Use `auto` wherever possible to remove any explicit mentioning of EDM4hep types.
    - Switch to range-based for-loops where possible
    - Keep an internal map of the collections to get rid of the `const_cast`s that were used before.
  - EDM4hep output: Make sure that the daughter relations are also set, because that is not done automatically in EDM4hep but is in LCIO.

  - Support for multiple readouts or (G4VUserParallelWorld equivalent)
    Issue https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/issues/861
    Example: 
    examples/CLICSiD/compact/SiD_ECAL_Parallel_Readout.xml + 
    examples/CLICSiD/scripts/SiD_ECAL_Parallel_Readout.py
  
    For a given subdetector the sequence of sensitive actions can be enhanced
    having multiple sensitive actions where each one can have its own Readout
    definition. Hence each action can produce its own set of hits depending on the
    readout geometry (segmentation).
    in XML these readout structures must first be defined:
  ```
    <readouts>
      <readout name="EcalBarrelHits">

  - Using `ref="OtherVisName"` attribute with the `vis` tag, the visualization attribute is an extension of
  `"OtherVisName"` which is used to initialize the new vis attribute.

  - This is the first release prepared to use Geant4 units (mm,ns,MeV). This compilation mode can be steered by a cmake flag: `-DDD4HEP_USE_GEANT4_UNITS=ON`. Once set, the flag is automatically propagated to depending projects in the generated `DD4hepConfig.cmake`. It programs TGeo to use the Geant4 units system. The unit system is applied also to depending quantities like interaction lengths etc.
  - Update some tests and ensure compatibility in the checks/reference files for both unit system. There is one caveat: Mesh-creation of shapes depends to some degree on the unit system, because mesh points are  removed depending on a tolerance value which is the same for both systems.
  - A fix had to be applied to propagate the flag `DD4HEP_BUILD_DEBUG` to depending projects.  This flag affects some object layouts and hence MUST be applied also to depending projects.
  - Remove inclusions of `Plugins.h` from being processed by rootcling. Plugins.h uses `#include <any>`, which cannot be processed.

      The example illustrates how to maniplulate the opening and the closing of the geometry using the compact notation.
      ```
       geoDisplay  -input file:SiD_multiple_inputs.xml \
                           -input file:SiD_detectors_1.xml \
                           -input file:SiD_detectors_2.xml \
                           -input file:SiD_close.xml \
                           -print INFO -destroy -volmgr -load```
  2) New example to scan the geometry starting from a given position in a certain direction. Command line like for g4MaterialScan.
      The output shows then the pathes to the volumes traversed, the shape and the material of these volumes.
  
      `g4GeometryScan --compact=DDDetectors/compact/SiD.xml --position=0,0,0 --direction=0,1,0`
  
     Resulting output:
     ```

  - The CAD volume plugin allows to embed valumes and shapes originating from Computer Aided Design drawings using multiple formats as they are supported by the open asset importer library (http://assimp.org ). The plugin can be used whenever the `xml` fragment matches the following pattern:
      ```xml
      <XXX ref="file-name"  material="material-name">   
        <material name="material-name"/>  <!-- alternative: child or attr -->
   
        Envelope:  Use special envelop shape (default: assembly)
                   The envelope tag must match the expected pattern of the utility
                   dd4hep::xml::createStdVolume(Detector& desc, xml::Element e)
        <envelope name="volume-name" material="material-name">
          <shape name="shape-name" type="shape-type" args....>
          </shape>
        </envelope>
   
        Option 1:  No additional children. use default material 
                   and place all children in the origin of the envelope
   
        Option 2:  Volume with default material
        <volume name="vol-name"/>
   
        Option 3:  Volume with non-default material
        <volume name="vol-name" material="material-name"/>
   
        Option 4:  Volume with optional placement. No position = (0,0,0), No rotation = (0,0,0)
        <volume name="vol-name" material="material-name"/>
          <position x="0" y="0" z="5*cm"/>

* 2020-02-25 Markus Frank ([PR#633](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/633))
  - Added basic implementation for CAD interface to load shapes from CAD files. There is an open issue how to best embed the volume/shape loading from CAD files into the existing infrastructure. See for [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/885083/contributions/3758180/attachments/1990793/3318984/2020-02-20-DD4hep-Tessellated-Shapes.pdf). This feature is only available if build against ROOT 6.22 or higher. 
  - DDCAD used the [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) librray to interprete the CAD files.
  - Simplify grammar instantiation. 
    - For grammars to be parsed with `boost::spirit` simply include
      `#include "DD4hep/detail/Grammar_parsed.h"`
    - For Grammars which should **not be parsed** with `boost::spirit` include
      `#include "DD4hep/detail/Grammar_unparsed.h"`
    - To instantiate the code and to register the instantiation call:
       `template <> dd4hep::Grammar<my-class>;`
    - If the Grammar is supposed to be registered call instead/in addition:
      `static auto s_registry = GrammarRegistry::pre_note<my-class>();`
     - All other macros are gone.

  - Resolves #605 
  - There was an apparent bug when cloning `DetElement` trees. Not only for the top element, which should receive a new ID, this top ID was propagated to all children. This was clearly wrong. The correct solution is: 
      - Top element gets a new ID
      - Children keep their ID
  - If a user wants to preserve the old functionality the flag `DetElement::PROPAGATE_PARENT_ID` must be set in the clone statement.

* 2019-08-22 Andre Sailer ([PR#552](https://github.com/AidaSoft/DD4hep/pull/552))
  * DD4hepConfig: `DD4hepConfig.CMake` now exports `DD4hep::DDCore` `DD4hep::<Component>` targets to be consumed by users of the DD4hep package, the CMake variables `DD4hep_LIBRARIES` etc. are still being filled for backward compatibility
  
  * DD4hep CMake: Only the `dd4hep_add_plugin` and `dd4hep_add_dictionary` CMake functions are to create targets still exist, `dd4hep_add_package`/`library`/`executable` were removed and instead the cmake `default add_library`/`executable` have to be used.

  - Moved `setDimensions` call out of the individual dd4hep shapes into the base Solid.
  - Add `Solid::dimensions()`, `Solid::setDimension()` implementation for `PseudoTrap` and  `TruncatedTube`. The solution is not optimal, because a analytical solution tends to be ambiguous due to solutions of polynomials of degree 2 and the initial parameters had to be stored as a string.
  - Upgraded shape tests to also check the shapes (using mesh vertices) after a re-dimension using the same parameters.
  - Geant4FieldTrackingSetup: Any failure in the creation of the `G4EquationOfMotion` or the `G4MagIntegratorStepper` is now FATAL and causes an exception.

* 2019-08-12 Markus Frank ([PR#549](https://github.com/AidaSoft/DD4hep/pull/549))
  - Adopted new Gaudi plugin manager V2. V1 can be enabled using compile switch in `DD4hep/config.h`. Removed the traces from the ROOT5 Reflex based plugin service. The new plugin service depends on `Boost::file_system` and `Boost::system`.

  - Add small example to test the basic development framework

* 2019-07-04 Markus Frank ([PR#520](https://github.com/AidaSoft/DD4hep/pull/520))
  - From ROOT 6.20 onwards dd4hep shall use the Geant4 unit system (mm, nsec, MeV) instead of the TGeo units (cm, sec, keV). This commit prepares for the necessary changes.
  - A new package was created, which shall host the dd4hep digitization components.
    A small tbb based multi threaded framework was put in place. Now the real work can start.
  - The material scanner has now a switch to run in interactive mode from the ROOT prompt.
    To invoke: materialScan compact.xml  x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 -interactive
    If the interactive switch is missing, the old behavior is preserved.

* 2019-06-26 Markus Frank ([PR#517](https://github.com/AidaSoft/DD4hep/pull/517))
  - Material properties use now default dd4hep units

  * Geant4GDMLWriteAction:
    * Add properties to Geant4GDMLWriteAction to steer writing of regions, cuts and sensitive detectors. See github issue #507
      * Property: Export region information to the GDML: ExportRegions, default: True
      * Property: Export energy cut information to the GDML: ExportEnergyCuts, default: True
      * Property: Export sensitive detector information to the GDML: ExportSensitiveDetectors, default: True
    * **Note: The Geant4 physics list must be initialized BEFORE invoking the writer with options. Otherwise the particle definitions are missing! If you ONLY want to dump the geometry to GDML you must call**
      ```
         /run/beamOn 0
      ```
      before writing the GDML file!
      You also need to setup a minimal generation action like:
       ```py
       sid.geant4.setupGun('Gun','pi-',10*GeV,Standalone=True)
       ```

  - Fix bug in `geoDisplay` to allow passing the volume display depth as an argument
  - Added a static creator to the Detector class to create non-traced instances: `std::unique_ptr<Detector> Detector::make_unique(const std::string& name);` It is the users responsibility to release the allocated resources and to avoid clashed with existing `TGeoManager` instances.
  -  Allow direct access to the solid instance of the DetElements's placement.

  - add `#include <memory>` to `run_plugin.h` (needed for `std::unique_ptr` and gcc 4.9)

* 2018-12-06 Markus Frank ([PR#468](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/468))
  - To fix issue #466  we had to go back to the original implementation which was actually correct (see https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/commit/36d4b01e0688f690ac2e506a62e00627bb6b798c#diff-7219d47bc4ab7516e0ca6c4f35f2602f).
  - Added an example to show how to perform scans of the volume hierarchy with user defined callback functors. See for details `examples/ClientTests/src/PlacedVolumeScannerTest.cpp`.
  
  - Added conversion between `TGeoArb8` and `G4GenericTrap`, fixes #465

* 2018-12-05 Markus Frank ([PR#467](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/467))
  - Harmonize argument names in `Shapes.h` with their actual functionality. For many shapes in `DD4hep/Shapes.h` the argument names were misleading: very often deltaPhi was mentioned, whereas the code actually used instead of (phi, deltaphi) the input arguments to the ROOT constructors (startPhi,endPhi) or (phi1, phi2).  Wherever ROOT uses (startPhi,endPhi) the argument names were changed accordingly. Please note a bug was found in the legacy constructor:
    ```cpp
      /// Legacy: Constructor to create a new identifiable tube object with attribute initialization
      Tube(const std::string& nam, double rmin, double rmax, double dz, double startPhi, double endPhi)
    ```
    Here opposite to all other constructors delta_phi was used as such - in contradiction to other constructors of the same class. This was rectified.

* 2018-11-30 Andre Sailer ([PR#462](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/462))
  - Introduce compile flag to minimize conditions footprint

* 2018-11-27 Markus Frank ([PR#461](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/461))
  - Add shape constructor for regular trapezoids (TGeoTrd1) ( see #460). Trd2 cannot be divided the same way as Trd1 shapes. Hence the addition became necessary. Due to the imprecise name of Trapezoid the names Trd1 and Trd2 (aka old Trapezoid) are favored. The usage of Trapezoid is supported for backwards compatibility using a typedef.

* 2018-11-22 Markus Frank ([PR#459](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/459))
  - Fix bug in DDCodex geometry, add debugging to VolumeBuilder

* 2018-11-14 Markus Frank ([PR#458](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/458))
  - Improve ROOT persistency: flag user extensions as persistent only while saving/loading
  - Need to rename DDEve library: nameclash with ddeve executable on Apple: cmake fails to build ddeve as exe and DDEve as library. libDDEve.so is now called libDDEvePlugins.so.

* 2018-11-13 Markus Frank ([PR#457](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/457))
  ## Provide support for Volume divisions.
  Since DD4hep requires Volumes (aka `TGeoVolume`) and PlacedVolumes (aka `TGeoNode`) to be enhanced with the user extension mechanism, therefore shape divisions **must** be done using the division mechanism of the DD4hep shape or the volume wrapper. Otherwise the enhancements are not added and you will get an exception when DD4hep is closing the geometry or whenever you do something with the volume, which is served by the user extension. The same argument holds when a division is made from a `Volume`. Unfortunately there is no reasonable way to intercept this call to the `TGeo` objects - except to the sub-class each of them, which is not really acceptable either.
  
  Hence: **If you use DD4hep: Never call the raw TGeo routines.**
     
  For any further documentation please see the following ROOT documentation on [TGeo](http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TGeoVolume.html)
  
  For an example see `examples/ClientTests/src/VolumeDivisionTest.cpp`
  and `examples/ClientTests/compact/VolumeDivisionTest.xml`
  
  To execute: 
  ```
  geoDisplay -input file:<path>/examples/ClientTests/compact/VolumeDivisionTest.xml

  # Implementation of non-cylindrical tracking region (resolves #371)
    -  It is possible to define volumes in a parallel world such as e.g. a tracking region. In principle any volume hierarchy may be attached to the parallel world. None of these volumes participate in the tracking as long as the "connected" attribute is set to false. The hierarchy of parallel world volumes can be accessed from the main detector object using
       ```cpp
       dd4hep::Volume parallel = dd4hep::Description::parallelWorldVolume()
       ```
    This parallel world volume is created when the geometry is opened together (and with the same dimensions) as the world volume itself.
    -  IF the NAME of the volumes is "tracking_volume" within the compact notation it is declared as the Detector's trackingVolume entity and is accessible as well:
       ```cpp
       dd4hep::Volume trackers = dd4hep::Description::trackingVolume()
       ```
    -  Although the concept is available in the DD4hep core, its configuration from XML is only implemented for the compact notation. For details see the example `examples/ClientTests/compact/TrackingRegion.xml`.
     -  If the volume should be connected to the world:   connected="true". This is useful for debugging because  the volume can be visualized else if the volume is part of the parallelworld: connected="false". The volume is always connected to the top level. The anchor detector element defines the base transformation to place the volume within the (parallel) world.
  
  ```xml
       <parallelworld_volume name="tracking_volume" anchor="/world" material="Air" connected="true" vis="VisibleBlue">
         <shape type="BooleanShape" operation="Subtraction">
           <shape type="BooleanShape" operation="Subtraction">
             <shape type="BooleanShape" operation="Subtraction"  >
               <shape type="Tube" rmin="0*cm" rmax="100*cm" dz="100*cm"/>
               <shape type="Cone" rmin2="0*cm" rmax2="60*cm" rmin1="0*cm" rmax1="30*cm" z="40*cm"/>
               <position x="0*cm" y="0*cm" z="65*cm"/>
             </shape>
             <shape type="Cone" rmin1="0*cm" rmax1="60*cm" rmin2="0*cm" rmax2="30*cm" z="40*cm"/>
             <position x="0" y="0" z="-65*cm"/>
           </shape>
           <shape type="Cone" rmin2="0*cm" rmax2="55*cm" rmin1="0*cm" rmax1="55*cm" z="30*cm"/>
           <position x="0" y="0" z="0*cm"/>
         </shape>
         <position x="0*cm"   y="50*cm" z="0*cm"/>
         <rotation x="pi/2.0" y="0"     z="0"/>
       </parallelworld_volume>

  # Enhancement of assemblies, regions and production cuts (resolves #373)
  On request from FCC particle specific production cuts may be specified in the compact notation. These production cuts (Geant4 currently supports these for e+, e-, gammas and protons) are specified as "cut" entities in the limitset. (See the example `examples/ClientTests/compact/Assemblies.xml`).
  
    - The hierarchy of cuts being applied is:
        - If present particle specific production cuts for a region are applied.
        - else the "cut" attribute of the compact region specification is used
        - else the global Geant4 cut is automaticallly applied by Geant4.
  
  ```xml
    <limits>
      <limitset name="VXD_RegionLimitSet">
        <!--
             These are particle specific limits applied to the region
             ending in Geant4 in a G4UserLimits instance
        -->
        <limit name="step_length_max"  particles="*" value="5.0" unit="mm" />
        <limit name="track_length_max" particles="*" value="5.0" unit="mm" />

             ending in Geant4 in a G4ProductionCuts instance
        -->
        <cut   particles="e+"          value="2.0"   unit="mm" />
        <cut   particles="e-"          value="2.0"   unit="mm" />

  # SensitiveDetector types not changed by Geant4SensDetActionSequence (resolves #378)
  The sensitive detector type defined in the detector constructors is no longer changed intransparently in the back of the users. This may have side-effects for creative detector constructor writers, who invent sd types out of the sky. These obviously will not work with Geant4, because in Geant4 a mapping of these types must be applied to supported sensitive detectors. Now the mapping of a sd type (e.g. "tracker") is strict in the python setup. The default factory to create any sensitive detector instance in Geant4 (ie. an object of type G4VSensitiveDetector, G4VSDFilter, Geant4ActionSD) is a property of the Geant4Kernel  instance and defaults to:
    ```cpp
     declareProperty("DefaultSensitiveType", m_dfltSensitiveDetectorType = "Geant4SensDet");
    ```
     - Since the actual behavior is defined in the sequencer instanciated therein this default should be sufficient for 99.99 % of all cases. Otherwise the factory named "Geant4SensDet" may be overloaded.

  - resolves #361
    The Detector object has a state `Detector::state()` with three values:
    ```cpp
      /// The detector description states
      enum State   {
        /// The detector description object is freshly created. No geometry nothing.
        NOT_READY = 1<<0,
        /// The geometry is being created and loaded. (parsing ongoing)
        LOADING   = 1<<1,
        /// The geometry is loaded.
        READY     = 1<<2
      };
    ```
      It starts with `NOT_READY`, moves to `LOADING` once the geometry is opened and goes to `READY` once the geometry is closed. As suggested in the developers meeting: the initial field object is invalid and gets created only once the geometry is opened. As a corollary, the field may not be accessed before. Geometry parsers must take this behavior into account! 
  
  - Address some compiler warnings.
    - Mainly add override/final statements in header files.
  - Implement a module to invoke python as a DD4hep plugin:
    invoked e.g. by: `geoPluginRun -plugin DD4hep_Python -dd4hep -prompt`
    ```
    geoPluginRun -plugin DD4hep_Python -help
    Usage: -plugin <name> -arg [-arg]                                                  
       name:   factory name     DD4hep_Python                                        
       -import  <string>        import a python module, making its classes available.
       -macro   <string>        load a python script as if it were a macro.          
       -exec    <string>        execute a python statement (e.g. import ROOT.    
       -eval    <string>        evaluate a python expression (e.g. 1+1)          
       -prompt                  enter an interactive python session (exit with ^D)   
       -dd4hep                  Equivalent to -exec "import dd4hep"                
       -help                    Show this online help message.                       
  
       Note: entries can be given multiple times and are executed in exactly the     
             order specified at the command line!                      
    ```
    Implementation wise the plugin is a simple CLI wrapper for TPython.

  -  Fix bug in Alignment test:
     - A long standing bug was fixed for the test `t_AlignDet_Telescope_align_new`.
     - It was assumed that the `DetElements` were ordered in memory, which is **not** true (probably due to memory randomization).
     - Moved to path dependent ordering. Test now OK.

  - Add possibility to parse `XML` from string
    - Please see  #288 for details.
    - The main interface was not changed. Rather a view to the Detector class supports this functionality.
     - The existing view `dd4hep::DetectorLoad` was enhanced to allow the required functionality:
     ```cpp
      Detector detector = ....;
      /// So here is the actual test: We parse the raw XML string
      DetectorLoad loader(detector);
      loader.processXMLString(buffer,0);
     ```
     - An example was added (`ClientTests/src/XML_InMemory.cpp`, which illustrates the usage).
  
  - Improve DDCond manual

  ### DDG4 enhancements
  - Enable framework support in DDG4. The `Geant4Context` is the main thread specific accessor to the `dd4hep`, `DDG4` and the user framework.
      - The access to the `dd4hep` objects is via the `Geant4Context::detectorDescription()` call,
      - the access to `DDG4` as a whole is supported via `Geant4Context::kernel()` and
      - the access to the user gframework using a specialized implementation of:
      `template <typename T> T& userFramework()  const;`
   
      A user defined implementations must be specialized somewhere in a compilation unit of the user framework, not in a header file. The framework object could host e.g. references for histogramming, logging, data access etc.
    
      This way any experiment/user related data processing framework can exhibit its essential tools to `DDG4` actions.
    
      A possible specialized implementations would look like the following:
    ```cpp
      struct Gaudi  {
        IMessageSvc*   msg;
        IHistogramSvc* histos;
        ....
      };
      template<> Gaudi& Geant4Context::userFramework<Gaudi>()  const  {
        UserFramework& fw = m_kernel->userFramework();
        if ( fw.first && &typeid(T) == fw.second ) return *(T*)fw.first;
        throw std::runtime_error("No user specified framework context present!");
      }
    ```  
      To access the user framework then use the following call:
      ```cpp
      Gaudi* fw = context->userFramework<Gaudi>();
      ```
      of course after having initialized it:
    ```cpp
      Gaudi * fw = ...;
      GaudiKernel& kernel = ...;
      kernel.setUserFramework(fw);
    ```
  
  - `G4RunManager` is now a plugin. To enable user defined run managers in `DDG4`, the run manager is encapsulated in a `Geant4Action`. See `DDG4/plugins/Geant4RunManagers.cpp` how to implement such plugins. Currently there are to factories implemented: 
     -  `G4RunManager` -> factory invokes the single threaded `G4RunManager`
     -  `G4MTRunManager `-> factory invokes the multi threaded `G4MTRunManager`
  
    The factory names here are identical to the names of the native G4 classes.

* 2017-11-30 Marko Petric ([PR#268](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/268))
  - Introduce new DD4hep web-site: http://dd4hep.cern.ch/

  - Add Support to Export and Import GDML Data
    - Allow extorts and imports of partial geometry trees with GDML. **This requires however a future version of ROOT**, since some changes were necessary in the ROOT GDML handlers. The code is commented out for the time being. The plugin implementation is in `DDCore/src/gdml/GdmlPlugin.cpp`
  - Remove print statements from DDG4 scripts
     - Replace prints with calls to the python logging utility. Hopefully this shall give at some point python3 compatibility.
  - Update `G4Stepper` factories

  ### VolumeManager Implementation
  A possibly important bug was fixed for the lookup of top level subdetectors in the `VolumeManager` by volume identifers of (sensitive) volumes. Due to a bug in the de-masking possible wrong top level subdetectors were returned. The default use cases typically do not use this call and hence should not be affected.

* 2017-10-17 Shaojun Lu ([PR#247](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/247))
  - Fix C++11 pointer error by adding include <memory> for 'unique_ptr' (GCC 4.9).

* 2017-10-13 Marko Petric ([PR#246](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/246))
  ### DDCMS:
  - Improve the CMS excercise. New examples etc.
  - Support for simulation using DDG4 (at least partially - since not all subdetector volumes are accepted by Geant4).
  
  ### DDG4:
  - Event reader returns `EVENT_READER_EOF` if `EOF` is detected rather than a generic IO error.
  - Add generator status word to the `Geant4Particle` object. Remove the extension mechanism, which is very heavy to just add one integer.
  
  ### General:
   - We need to distinguish the plugins using some namespace mechanism. I started to introduce the namespace separator `"_".` Hence all DD4hep plugins start with `DD4hep_<plugin>`. I hope this does not break everything. If it does, please notify me and we can undo.

* 2017-10-13 Whitney Armstrong ([PR#243](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/243))
  - Added helper function `getAttrOrDefault` (defined in  `DDCore/include/XML/Helper.h`) 
   This  function `getAttrOrDefault(xml::Element e, xml::XmlChar attr_name, T default_value)` will return the attribute  name,  converted to to type `T` but if it is not found it will return `default_value`. When building new detectors supplying this is useful for supplying default attribute values.

* 2017-10-19 Markus Frank ([PR#249](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/249))
  * Improve the CMS tracker visualisation
  * Add DDG4 simulation example to DDCMS
  * Add some plugins to add visualisation attributes if required (not for the compact description)

* 2017-11-01 David Blyth ([PR#254](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/254))
  - DDG4/python/DDG4.py: loadDDG4() changed to not raise exception if libraries are already loaded

* 2017-11-01 David Blyth ([PR#252](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/252))
  - Added requirement of Python 2 in cmake/FindPYTHON.cmake.  This makes clear the requirement of Python 2, and resolves the issue where CMake tries to build with Python 3 in a system where both exist.

* 2017-11-07 Frank Gaede ([PR#256](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/256))
  - bug fix in `BitField64::operator[std::string]() `

# v01-03

* 2017-10-12 Frank Gaede ([PR#244](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/244))
  - allow for unbounded surfaces in DDRec
       - add new property `SurfaceType::Unbounded`
       - if a surface is marked unbounded `Surface::insideBounds()` ignores the volume boundaries (and only checks the distance to the surface)

* 2017-09-19 Whitney Armstrong ([PR#233](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/233))
  - Added helper  `CellIDPositionConverter::cellDimensions(const CellID& cell)`

  - Created a new example showing the CMS tracking detector
    - Get CMS going with their evaluation. Added a package DDCMS with the conversion plugins for the silicon trackers and the corresponding conversion mechanism for their `xml` structure.

* 2017-09-18 Frank Gaede ([PR#232](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/232))
  - fix reading of stdhep/lcio generator files with generator statuses not in [0,3]
  - add `G4PARTICLE_GEN_BEAM` and `G4PARTICLE_GEN_OTHER` to DDG4
    -  `G4PARTICLE_GEN_BEAM`  is generally agreed to be used for beam particles (HepMC, LCIO)
    -  all other status codes vary from generator to generator and we use OTHER
  - for stdhep or lcio input the true generator status is preserved in the lcio output, regardless of its value
  - create a vertex for every parent-less particle in LCIOEventReader
    - this allows for example to read GuineaPig files ( non-prompt pair particles) or special user created files with non-prompt particles
   - Resolves #101

* 2017-09-20 Markus Frank ([PR#235](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/235))
  - A more complete version of the CMS tracker
     - Enhanced the CMS tracker example to be more complete.
     - Stopped at some point to convert all CMS algorithms. Hence, the tracker is not complete, but the remaining work looks to be purely mechanical.

* 2017-10-02 Frank Gaede ([PR#239](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/239))
  - add cell sizes to printout of `LayeredCalorimeterData::layer`

  - add ncellsX/Y as a "parameter", allowing it to be set in compact description. This change is for easier use in the case of a MultiSegmentation. (Only a uniform segmentation can be defined in this way: for more complex cases, must set by driver.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  - change from array to std::vector to store ncells information

  ## Implement ROOT persistency mechanism for detector descriptions (continuation of AIDASoft/DD4hep#202).
  Object extensions are now persistent.                                                                   
                                                                                                          
  This is however not for free: **it requires a dictionary for the extension itself and it requires a dictionary for the class holding the extension**. These are:
   - `dd4hep::DetElement::DetElementExtension<IFACE,CONCRETE>` for `DetElement` extensions.                                                                       
   - `dd4hep::SimpleExtension<IFACE,CONCRETE>` for simple extension managed by the user framework (user calls explicitly destructor).                             
   - `dd4hep::DeleteExtension<IFACE,CONCRETE>` for simple extension managed by dd4hep (dd4hep calls automatically destructor on hosting object destruction).      
   - `dd4hep::CopyDeleteExtension<IFACE,CONCRETE>`. As above, but these extensions support calling the copy constructor of the embedded object and hence allow to copy also the hosting objects.
                                                                                                                                                                                                
  Please note: to persistify these objects it was necessary to no longer use the type-info of the objects as an identifier, but rather a 64-bit-hash of the raw type-info-name. This relies that this name is identical across platforms.

  ## Implement ROOT persistency mechanism for detector descriptions              
                                                                                 
  The following commits allow to save and restore Detector objects (ie. the full detector description) to/from ROOT. Most changes affected the usage of void pointers. 
                                                                                                                                                                       
  It is **NOT** possible to:                                                                                                                                           
   * save object extensions. Another usage of void pointers and type-info objects, which both cannot be saved.                                                         
   * save callback objects. Callbacks store in memory pointers to member functions. These depend on the loading of libraries at run-time and hence may differ from application to application.
   * save conditions slices. This shall be a futute extension. There should be no fundamental problem doing so - it was simply not yet done.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                              
  In the example area a new slot call "Persistency" was created with various tests:                                                                                                           
   * Save and restore simple conditions                                                                                                                                                       
   * Save and restore the MiniTel detector (`examples/ClientTests/compact/MiniTel.xml`)                                                                                                       
   * Save and restore the CLICSiD detector (`examples/CLICSiD/compact/compact.xml`)                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                              
  The detector examples also have a set of tests associated to check the validity of the restored information.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                              
  ## Integrate `DDSegmentatation` into `DDCore`                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                              
  As a first step to start the cleanup of `DDSegmentation` the code was integrated into `DDCore`. For backwards compatibility a dummy library `libDDSegmentation.so` is kept, so that client cmake files directly referring `DDSegmentation` still work. **This tough is only a temporary measure and users should remove references to the DDSegmentation library.** Include files can be accessed as before. These are part of the `DDCore` include directory.

  ## Enhance ROOT Detector Description Persistency                               
  Conditions slices from the DD4hep conditions store can now be saved to ROOT files ans named objects. Conditions persistency examples are added to the `examples/Conditions` section.
  The examples are derived from the Telescope and CLICSiD example:

  ## Fix Handle Problem when Accessing Materials from Volumes                                                                                                                         
  A cast problem was not spotted in the last commit, which manifested itself in accessing invalid materials from volumes. This commit resolves #211 , reported by @jhrdinka.          
                                                                                                                                                                                      
  A set of tests checks this behaviour in the ClientTests: `ClientTests_volume_materials_<text>`, where the volume tree is scanned and for all sensitive volumes and access the corresponding `materials/TGeoMedium` entities from the volume object.

  ## Implement ROOT persistency mechanism for the conditions                     
                                                                                 
  Conditions pools can now be made persistent provided all the dictionaries for the payload objects are provided. A new class `ConditionsRootPersistency` allows to save and re-load conditions pools to/from a ROOT file. Such pools can either be:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
   - Simple `ConditionsPool` objects                                                                                                                                                                                                         
   - The entire `IOV` indexed pool set (class `ConditionsIOVPool`) or                                                                                                                                                                        
   - A the pool used by a `ConditionsSlice` (class `UserPool`).
   - A std::vector<Condition> which belong all to the same IOV

  In any case the restoration of the saved conditions is performed through the `ConditionsManager` interface in order to ensure proper management of the added condition objects.

  Some example plugin tasks were added in examples/Conditions:
   - `DD4hep_ConditionExample_save` to save conditions to a ROOT file.
   - `DD4hep_ConditionExample_load` to restore conditions from file.

  Others to come.

  ## Split of dictionary files
  The ROOT dictionary creation in `DDCore` was getting increasingly large. Now the ROOT dictionaries are created in several files, what firstly allows them to be produced in parallel and secondly eases the compilation due to smaller generated file sizes.

  ## DDCore: Changes to the VolumeManager interface
  
    Recent descrepancies showed that the call to lookup a placement
    from the volume manager may have an ambiguous meaning:
    It may (as used until now) be the placement of thge closest
    detector element - a functionality used by various tests
    or be the placement of the sensitive volume itself.
    So far, since each sensitive volume in the DD4hep tests
    is represented by a DetElement structure, both
    approaches returned the same placed volume.
  
    Since there is the possibility to have sensitive volumes, which are not
    directly connected to a single DetElement structure, this call was
    split to resolve this ambiguity:
  
    /// Lookup a physical (placed) volume identified by its 64 bit hit ID
    PlacedVolume lookupVolumePlacement(VolumeID volume_id) const;
    /// Lookup a physical (placed) volume of the detector element
    /// containing a volume identified by its 64 bit hit ID
    PlacedVolume lookupDetElementPlacement(VolumeID volume_id) const;

  ## DD4hep namespace reorganization
  
  Re-organize namespaces according to the decisions of the DD4hep developers meeting from 16th June we have decided:
  
  1. all namespaces will be lower case and shorter
      * rename namespace `DD4hep` -> `dd4hep`
      * rename namespace `DD4hep::DDRec` -> `dd4hep::rec`
      * rename namespace `DD4hep::Simulation` -> `dd4hep::sim`
      * rename namespace `XML` -> `xml` and `JSON` -> `json`
      * rename all other namespaces according to this pattern
  2. The namespace `DD4hep::Geometry::` will be incorporated into `dd4hep::`
  3. All utilities will be moved `dd4hep::detail`
  4. `LCDD` will be renamed to `Detector` and current `Detector.h` will be renamed to `DetElement.h`
  8. Examine if `DDSegmentation` can be incorporated into `DDCore` and make it volume aware
      * If this this cannot be achieved in whole place `DDSegmentation` into the right namespace
  
    ## DDParsers
  
    DDParsers are now a separate package. This does not make it yet standalone,
    but it is at the same level as e.g. DDSeqmentation. Any librarian is
    encouraged to externialize it fully.

# v00-24

* 2017-06-08 Markus Frank ([PR#160](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/160))
  * Add a new class `AlignmentsNominalMap`, which behaves like a `ConditionsMap` and handles alignment entries. 
  * The `AlignmentsNominalMap` is not a conditions cache per-se. This implementation  behaves like a `conditionsmap`, but it shall not return real conditions to the user, but rather return the default alignment objects (which at the basis are conditions as well) to the user. These alignments are taken from the `DetElement` in question `Alignment DetElement::nominal()`.
  
  * The basic idea is to enable users to write code "as if" there would be conditions present. This is important to ease in the lifetime of the experiment the step from the design phase (where obviously no conditions are taken into account) to a more mature phase, where alignment studies etc. actually are part of the "bread and butter work".
  
  * Added a corresponding example in examples/AlignDet:
  ```
  $>   geoPluginRun -volmgr -destroy -plugin DD4hep_AlignmentExample_nominal \
           -input file:${DD4hep_DIR}/examples/AlignDet/compact/Telescope.xml
  ```
     * Access the DetElement nominal conditions using the `AlignmentNominalMap`.
     Any use of DDCond is inhibited.
       1) We use the generic printer, which during the detector element scan accesses the conditions map.
       2) We use a delta scanner to extract the nominal deltas from the `DetElement`'s nominal alignments
       3) We use a `ConditionsTreeMap` to perform the alignments re-computation.

* 2017-06-08 Markus Frank ([PR#159](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/159))
  # Implementation of the decisions made at the Conditions mini-workshop
  
  ## Access mechanisms of DD4hep conditions for utilities
  
  Access to conditions is solely supported using the interface class DDCore/ConditionsMap.
  * All utilities must use this interface.
  * Any concrete implementation using conditions/alignment utilities must implement this interface
  * Basic implementation using STL `map`, `multimap` and `unordered_map` are provided.
  * A special no-op implementation of this interface shall be provided to access "default" alignment conditions. This implementation shall fall-back internally to the `DetElement::nominal()` alignment. 
  Known clients: `VolumeManager` (hence: DDG4, DDRec, etc.)
  
  Though this sounds like a trivial change, the consequences concern the entire conditions
  and alignment handling. This interface decouples entirely the core part of DD4hep
  from the conditions cache handling and the alignment handling.
  
  Based on this interface most utilities used to handle conditions, detectors scans
  to visit `DetElement` related condition sets, alignment and conditions printers etc.
  
  For details, please see:
  ```
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/AlignmentsPrinter.h
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/AlignmentsProcessor.h
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/ConditionsPrinter.h
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/ConditionsProcessor.h
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/DetectorProcessor.h
  ```
  
  ## Naming conventions for detector conditions
  
  * Condition are logically attached to DetElements
     * Condition names are: `DetElement.path()+"#"+condition-name`
         Example: `/world/LHCb/DownstreamRegion/Muon/M5/M5ASide/R3ASide/Cham046#alignment`
  
  * Condition keys are a `int64` compound of two `int32`:
  ```cpp
     union {
       int64 key;
       struct {
         int32 item_key;
         int32 det_key;     // Needs to be the high word to have a properly ordered map
       } values;
     };
     det_key  = hash32(DetElement.path())
     item_key = hash32(condition-name)
  ```
     **Condition keys must be unique throughout the detector description.**
  
  * Alignment conditions naming conventions:
    * Alignment-delta conditions are called `alignment_delta`.
    * Fully qualified alignment conditions are called `alignment`.
     DD4hep provided alignment utilities rely on this convention.
  
  * Other conditions can be named freely.
  
  ## Important Notice
  The **Alignment conditions naming conventions** are already used by several utilities involving alignments. If you plan to use these, do not freely ignore these recommendations. When the naming conventions are ignored, these utilities shall not work.
  
  ## Updates to DDCond
  DDCond implements a working conditions cache following the design criteria sketched above. The `conditionsSlice` object implements (though by forwarding to the `ConditionsUserPool`) a `ConditionsMap` interface.
  
  The `DD4hep_ConditionsMapUserPool` plugin implements in a very efficient way this interface using an ordered map. Using the above described key definition, this implementation allows very efficient scans of conditions/alignments etc. of individual detector elements, since conditions which belong to the same detector element are contiguous.
  
  ## Alignment handling/computations
  Using the conditions maps, the computation of (mis-)alignment data from deltas
  is no longer bound to the conditions mechanisms.
  
  A special utility called `AlignmentsCalculator` is put in place (see `DDCore/include/DD4hep/AlignmentsCalculator.h`) to facilitate the computation of a coherent set of alignments given a set of delta-parameters. This mechanism is much simpler, easier to understand and far less code intensive than the previously designed callback mechanism where alignments are obtained using conditions derivation.
  
  ## Update of the existing examples
  
  The example sets in DDDB, `examples/Conditions, examples/AlignDet`, `examples/DDDB` were updated according to the changed mechanism of accessing conditions. Here we can see the real benefits of the new approach: keeping same functionality, the examples became way off simpler. Simply count the number of lines of code.

  Improvements to the compact xml processing
  ===========================================
  
  Elements may now be specified within compact in 2 ways:
  1) old way: create an effective element:
  `    <element Z="4" formula="Be" name="Be" >`
  `      <atom type="A" unit="g/mol" value="9.01218" />`
  `    </element>`
  
  2) create element by defining an isotope mixture:
  `    <isotope name="C12" Z="6" N="12"/>`
  `      <atom unit="g/mole" value="xxxx"/>`
  `    </isotope>`
  `.....`
  `   <element name="C">`
  `     <fraction n="0.9893" ref="C12"/>`
  `     <fraction n="0.0107" ref="C13"/>`
  `   </element>`
  
  Improved debugging of compact xml conversions
  The following tags allow to enable increased prinout depending on additional tags in the compact file:
  `    <debug>`
  `      <type name="isotopes"     value="1"/>`
  `      <type name="elements"     value="1"/>`
  `      <type name="materials"    value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="visattr"      value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="regions"      value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="readout"      value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="limits"       value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="segmentation" value="0"/>`
  `    </debug>`
  
  Disable the ROOT TGeo element table from the compact xml. 
  Note: ALL elements must then be specified in the XML material database.
  `    <geometry>`
  `      <clear name="elements"/>`
  `    </geometry>`
  
  By default compact accepts exactly one input file (others may be included therein).
  In order to process iteratively multiple input files, the opening and the closing of the
  geometry steering tags may be added to the compact description. This example 
  gives the default behaviour:
  `    <geometry open="true" close="true"/>`
  
  Please note: per compact file exactly ONE geometry tag is allowed.
  
  
  Debugging the DDG4 geometry conversion mechanism
  =============================================
  New boolean properties of the Geant4DetectorGeometryConstruction object,
  which result in debugging printouts (defaults are OFF):
    DebugMaterials
    DebugElements
    DebugShapes
    DebugVolumes
    DebugPlacements
    DebugRegions
    PrintPlacements
    PrintSensitives

-  Due to pressure of the FCC folks, I tried to implement a more dd4hep like implementation of the
  the segmentation objects. For testing only CartesianGridXY. If this mechanism works,
  it could be a starting recipe for the rest of the segmentations. The draw-back of this approach is,
  that assignments are not reversible:
  dd4hep::CartesianGridXY xy = readout.segmentation();  // Works
  dd4hep::Segmentation seg = xy;                    // Should not work

-  Reason: the managed objects are different....at some point in time I will have to find a
  clean solution for this, but the required changes for such a solution shall be manageable.

	Used by the DDDB implementation/example. DDDB is an alternative way to populate the dd4hep
	detector description using LHCb's detector description database.
	The reason is, that only a running experiment has a reasonable base to conditions data
	to excercise the dd4hep conditions.
	If interested, please have a look in the DDDB examples.

* 2016-05-03 M.Frank
- Green light is ON. You may use revision 2237 and above.

* 2016-05-03 M.Frank
- **Mega commit. Do not use until green signal arrives with seperate release notice.**
- Package DDDB: Prove of concept, that we can populate the geometry also from other
  sources than xml files obeying the lccdd notation.
- DDCore/XML: Implement the possibility to use external entity resolution for Xerces.
  There is not equivalent in TinyXML (AFAIK).
- Remove some of the Spirit parsers, since the libraries are getting way too big.
  This implicitly assumes, that object properties of 'exotic' types such as
  deque<long double> etc. are not really used. If you need properties stay to the obvious:
  string, int float, double and vectors, maps and sets thereof!
- DDG4 needed to public the DDG4Python include directory (Now in DDG4/Python).
  Reason: try to create ROOT 6 dictionaries, which can be relocated for release purposes.
- ROOT 6 dictionary generation: Create dictionaries with the additional flag:
  "-inlineInputHeader" which physically includes the header files used to generate the 
  dictionaries --> relocatability.

* 2016-03-21 M.Frank
- Add additional vertex argument to EventReader::readParticles, which supposedly should

* 2016-03-03 M.Frank
- Improve/complete job options type palette. 
- Allow modify the Geant4IsotropGenerator to shoot particle distributions according
  to several distributions:
  flat in : uniform, cos(theta), eta/pseudorapidity, ffbar (1+cos^2 theta)
  Option: generator.Distribution = 'cos(theta)'
  Default is uniform.

  dumpdetector compact.xml -d 


* 2015-12-09 N.Nikiforou
- UtilityApps/teveDisplay
  - Modified teveDisplay to have three separate collections of surface vectors (u,v,n) 
    instead of one collection. Now the vectors are colored differently.
  - Changed signature of getSurfaceVectors() to allow selection of o,u,v,n vectors to 
    add to the collection, added option for name and color of collection.
  - Renamed surface list collections to "HelperSurfaces" and "SensitiveSurfaces".

    functionality.
  - Support for python configuration (see manual for details)
  - Support for global Geant4Actions executing in thread reentrant shared mode.
    (see manual for details)
  - DDG4 examples: DDG4/examples/CLICSidSimu.py deleted and replaced with:
    1) DDG4/examples/SiDSim.py  (single threaded, old example)

    tests of hits.

* 2015-10-09 M.Frank
- DDG4
  - Extend the functionality of the DDG4 plugins
    Geant4InteractionVertexBoost and Geant4InteractionVertexSmear.
    If the Mask property is set to -1, all interactions present
    at call time are smeared/boosted according to the parameters.
    Note, that the position of the plugins within the generation 
    sequence is important.
  - Add a new generator Geant4GeneratorWrapper to allow the use
    of native G4 generator classes such as the G4ParticleGun or
    the G4GeneralParticleSource. Still to be tested.
  - Extend the Geant4Random functionality: May now be instantiated
    like any other Geant4Action. Users may set the seed or the 
    luxury level.
    All calls to HepRandom (CLHEP) or gRandom (ROOT) will re-use 
    this instance. See DDG4/examples/CLICRandom.py for illustration.

-  added starter docs dd4hepStartersGuide.pdf

*** **Important** ***
  **Before updating, backup your existing and working checkout. Though I was running 
  the basic tests, there may be unchecked corners of the software.**

Notes:
- Backwards compatibility mode for the usage of ROOT 5 and ROOT 6 alternatively.
- For ROOT 6 the Gaudi PluginService is used and added to the distribution.
- dd4hep is distributed with a licence. See $DD4hepINSTALL/LICENSE for details.
- In the doc area the $DD4hepINSTALL/doc/CREDITS file everybode should add her/his 
  name, if contributed significantly.
- Unfortunately this meant to add/change the headers of all files and give a 
  pointer to the licence file. If I accidentally changed the author name, please
  chagne it back.
- The plugin factory declaration statements were changed to accomodate both
  ROOT 5 and ROOT 6 and to keep the number of 'ifdef' statements at a minimum.
- TODO: Properly change the cmake scripts to accomodate for ROOT 6 and the 
  automatic switch when building dd4hep. 
- For reference reasons: this commits is revision 1812 + 1813 (DDDetectors)

# v00-13

  additional parameters required by Pandora:
  - inner_phi0 (e.g. alignment for inner symmetry)
  - outer_phi0 (e.g  aligment for outer symmetry)
  - NOTE: phi0 still remains but is deprecated
  - gap0 (e.g stave gap along r-phi)  
  - gap1 (e.g middle stave gap along z)
  - gap2 (reserved for future use)

* 2014/06/30 Markus Frank
- DDG4: Support user (context-) extensions for Geant4.
  User contexts are availible for events and runs. The contexts
  are accessible from the Geant4Context meber of each Geant4Action,
  the base class for all processing entities.
   - Adding a context:
```
      context()->event().addExtension(pointer_to_object, typeid(TYPE), 0);
      or 
      context()->event().addExtension<TYPE>(pointer_to_object);
      In the first case the object is NOT DELETED at the end of the event.
      In the second case the object is deleted.
```      
    - Accessing the context:
```    
          TYPE* ctx = context()->event().extension<TYPE>(false);
      The boolean argument indicates if an exception should be thrown
      if the extension is not present ie. here no exception.
```      
- DDCore: adjust a few print statements.

* 2014/06/27 Markus Frank
- Separate XML loading from Detector implementation.

* 2014/06/19 Frank Gaede
- replaced TGeoUnits.h by  DD4hepUnits.h
- renamed namespace tgeo to dd4hep -> users need to replace tgeo::mm by dd4hep::mm


* 2014/06/12 Frank Gaede
- changed default unit for angles to be radians   (tgeo::rad = 1.)
- enforce usage of units from TGeoUnits.h in xml expression evaluators
- convert to degrees for angles in TGeoShapes constructors
- NB: there is one inconsistency left here:  angles returned
  from TGeoShapes are already in degrees, this is the one
  case where a quantity returned from dd4hep/TGeo does not have the default
  units - thus one should not write
  
 ` double phi = coneSeg.Phi1() / tgeo::rad ;`
 
  but rather
  
  `double phi = coneSeg.Phi1() * tgeo::deg ;`


* 2014/06/03 Markus Frank
- Provision for ROOT persistency for dd4hep detector descriptions:
  Create Cint dictionary for dd4hepCore by default when building the library.
  For the time being the area of DDSegmentation is left out, since these
  objects require changes due to the handling of references and template
  specializations. Besides these, dd4hep detector descriptions can be
  saved and read-back directly to/from ROOT files - which may improve
  a lot the startup time of processes.

- The DDG4 dictionary is created by default when building the library.
  When importing DDG4 from python only the dd4hepCore dd4hepG4 libraries
  must be present. It should no longer be necessary to compile the
  necessary AClick on the fly.

- Investigations on wirframe drawing:
  Wireframes are a property of the scene graph. You can toggle to wireframe
  using the 'w' key on the keyboard. Other representations are 
  'r': Solid view
  't': Solid + wireframe view.
  This information is accessible from the help menu of the ROOT OGL widget.

# v00-07
* 2014/05/28 Markus Frank

- Several fixes and improvements in DDG4
  - Cache output levels in Geant4Kernel object
  - Add shell handler to measure energy escape e.g. in calorimeters
- Fix bug in Polycone shapes concerning angles.
      **IMPORTANT: If you forked the repository examples/CLICSiD
      your PolyconeSupport does not work anymore, because the angles
      were given in degrees. They should be given in radians!**

* 2014/05/21 Markus Frank
- Fix material creation from XML
    JIRA bug: dd4hep -  DDFORHEP-4
    https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/DDFORHEP-4
    using <composite> in material xml files results in wrong material properties

- Fix JIRA bug: dd4hep -   DDFORHEP-3
    https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/DDFORHEP-3
   Recursive assemblies result in error in TGeo geometry
    Bug results in errors when closing the geometry like:
    "Error in <TGeoVoxelFinder::SortAll>: Wrong bounding box for volume SIT_assembly"

- Provision to store survey constants to the DetElement as an extension
    for Alignment calculations (priv. comm. C.Parkes)

- Fix bug in expression evaluation of angles.
    All detector constructors receive angles in "rad". No correction 
    from degree to rad should be necessary.

* 2014/05/21 Frank Gaede
- add MaterialManager class providing
  - access to materials at any point or on straight
    line between two points
  - creation of material with averaged properties (A,Z,rho,x0,Lambda)
 
- added utility print_materials to print material properties along  
  a straight line between two points including integrated radiation and 
  interaction lengths (useful for debugging geometries and materials)
 
- use avaeraged material for Surfaces where the thickness extends
  beyond the volume boundaries
   - introduced new simple data class MaterialData for this       
    

- known issues
   - materials don't work for detectors with assemblies in assemblies
        as the TGeo navigation dose not seem to work:
	Error in <TGeoVoxelFinder::SortAll>: Wrong bounding box for volume SIT_assembly
        -> ROOT bug or feature ?

    - using <composite/> in compound materials results in incorrect material properties
       see ILDExDet/compact/materials Polysterene as example


* 2014/05/06 Frank Gaede
- DDSurfaces/DDRec:
  - added ICylinder and CylinderSurface to provide
    access to cylinder radius for the tracking
- teveDisplay: 
  - draw sensitive surfaces in red and helper surfaces in gray
  - protect against missing lcio input file
  - reduced printout from VolumeManager  (changed INFO to DEBUG)

* 2014/04/05-2014/04/29 Frank Gaede
- Implementation of Surface classes for track reconstruction
  - abstract interfaces in DDSurface:  ISurface and IMaterial  
  - implementation in DDRec:  Surface, SurfaceManager, DetectorSurfaces
  - basic functionality exists:
  - meassurement surface vectors u,v, normal and origin
  - check if point is inside the bounds of the corresponding volume
  - currently the material is taken to be the one from the volume 
      -> to do: average material if surface thicknesses extend beyond the
                volume for comound materials
  - added drawing of surfaces and (Sim)TrackerHits and (Sim)CalorimeterHits to teveDisplay
     ( link lcio file to teve_infile.slcio )
  - added some surfaces to ILDExDet: VXD, SIT, TPC
  - added test_surfaces to ILDExSimu
     (fails currently for some hits that are not created on the surface ...)
  - added some assemblies to ILDExDet to better structure the geometry hierarchy   

* 2014/04/28  Markus Frank
- First attempt to understand fully the handling of recursive assemblies
     from the 2014/04/25 was apparently with limited success. Now they should
     work!

* 2014/04/25  Markus Frank
- Moved boost::spirit parsers to DDCore, since these parsers are also used
     in other packages such as DDCond and DDAlign - whenever strings have to be
     converted to objects.
     Consequently, the boost spirit code fragments were removed from DDG4.
- Improved and more correct type checking when assigning handles
- Explicit implementation of the object extension mechanism to be used 
     through inheritance or aggregation rather than having seperate and nearly
     identical implementations for various objects.
- Improved defintition of basic objects describing Conditions and Alignment.
- Improved implementation of DDAlign, the alignment support.
     Not to be used currently - experimental package.
- Initial implementation of DDCond the package supporting the handling of 
     conditions.
     Not to be used currently - experimental package.
- Geant4Converter: I convinced myself, that the bug in handling assemblies
     of assemblies is resolved. To be tested though.

* 2014/02/07  Frank Gaede
- added DDGear, support for interfacing to gear for backward compatibility
  - lives currently in ILDExDet ( should become (optional) part of core dd4hep)
  - users need to GearParameter objects as extensions to the DetElement
       -> see ILDExTPC_geo.cpp, ILDExVXD_geo.cpp, ILDExTPCSIT_geo.cpp as examples
  - program convertToGear creates gear xml file from compact file 
       ( only if  GearParameter objects are avialble as extensions)
  - added test_convert_ild_gear 
- fixed  geometry in ILDExVXD_geo.cpp, ILDExTPCSIT_geo.cpp
     wrt. to position of support ans sensitive ladders

# v00-06   
* 2014/02/04  Frank Gaede
- fixed environment scripts thisdd4hep.sh and this${PackageName}.sh
    to also export library pathes for external libraries (CLHEP, LCIO, gear)

- added some simple tests to ILDExDet, ILDExSimu and noviceN04
  - provide cmake script run_test_package.sh ( configured as run_test_${PackageName} ) 
      to call test binaries after initializing the environment
      (needed for automated/nightly tests)

- updated Readme.txt wrt build procedure and running the tests


* 2014/01/17    Markus Frank
- Prepare implementation of Alignment using Release and Grap features of TGeoVolume
    and TGeoNode. In principle this was done in a backwards compatible way, but 
    I cannot really check 100% the #ifdef's.
- Fix handling of XML collections using XercesC.
    (Bug reported by P.Kostka).
- Fix several compiler warnings issued by Coverity.

* 2013/12/17    Markus Frank
- Whole load of fixes to keep coverity quiet....
- Fix bug in DDG4 field interface component
- Allow the usage of units, positions and lorentzvectors and in DDG4 properties.
    Example using a position property (ROOT::Math::XYZVector):
    Idle> /ddg4/Gun/position (1*mm,1*cm,0.01*m) 
    Geant4UIMessenger: +++ Gun> Setting property value position = (1*mm,1*cm,0.01*m)  
                       native:( 1 , 10 , 10 ).

- Support for std::vector<T>/std::list<T>/std::set<T> properties.

  - Support for include directives of the format
```
        <include ref="file-name"/>
    for the top level <lccdd> tags
       Parent tag    Included root tag  Data content
    -- <lccdd>       <define>           See below.
                     <detectors>
		     <detector>
		     <display>
		     <lccdd>            Nested includes (with DTD validation for Xerces-C)
    -- <define>      <define>           Set of constants
    -- <detectors>   <detector>         Single XML subdetector description
    -- <detectors>   <detectors>        Multiple XML subdetector descriptions
    -- <display>     <display>          Set ov visualization attributes

    DTD validation is only performed using Xerces-C for root tags <lccdd>.
```
- Note: 
    `<lccdd>` include directives are executed BEFORE any other directive!
    Other include directives are executed BEFORE the corresponding named directive!

* 2013/11/14    Markus Frank
- Reformat files in DDCode and DDG4 to remove the <TAB>s from the source files.
    Hopefully the content is now more readable.
- DDCore: Remove empty and named constructors for shapes. Empty constructors
    were simply a dangerous hook to memory leaks, named constructors are 
    deprecated since along time.
- DDG4: add support for messengers to access and modify properties from
    the Geant4 prompt. For the test hit classes and the simple sensitive 
    detector a ROOT I/O plugin was provided.
- DDG4: Split into several libraries:
  - libDDG4.so pure    link library without any plugins
  - libDDG4Legacy.so   'Old' plugins. The old stuff at some point
                               will have to disappear.
  - libDDG4Plugins.so  New framework plugins
  - libDDG4LCIO.so     LCIO output plugin for new framework

* 2013/11/03    Markus Frank
- doc: Add CHEP2013 paper about dd4hep as a start of the documentation 
    section. More to come hopefully.
- DDCore: several small improvements:
  - Segmentations are no longer Ref_t's.
  - Base internal implementing object directly on the segmentations 
      classes from Christian.
  - Rearrangement of some code from Handle.h to Primitives.h
  - Allow to attach extensions to Detector
- DDG4: Fix Frank's simulation problem, which he caused himself
    introducing his famous factories....
- DDG4: First attempt to fix simulation problem with mignetic field.
    Ready for testing.
- DDG4: First commit of a independent simulation aimed for LHCb and LHeC
    + other newcomers. Documentation needs to be written.
    Features:
  - Modular setup of all Geant4 action routines as plugins, including the
      Run-, event-, tracking-, stacking-, stepping- and generator-actions 
      as well as the physics lists with particle and physics constructors.
  - Setup is possible in XML or with C++ either as an AClick in root or
      standalone. Python based starter to come.
  - Missing is a modular description of the G4 UI and VIS manager(s).
  - Documentation is to come. Before documentation is not present
      the usage is discouraged.
    Note:
  - This version of DDG4 uses boost::spirit. It will compile without
      the BOOST include files and the old functionality is preserved, 
      but it will not work.
      To use BOOST add to the cmake statement the following tags:
      cmake <regular tags> \
      -DDD4HEP_USE_BOOST=ON \
      -DBOOST_INCLUDE_DIR=${BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR}  ....
      Where BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR should point to the boost header directory.
      BOOST libraries are not used.

* 2013/10/18    Markus Frank
- Throw exception if the expression evaluator sees a problem.
    The message printed before was often not seen.
- Improve printout on exceptions and plugin abortion
- Remove the typedef RotationZYX -> Rotation and
    import the type RotationZYX from ROOT::Math.

- Add more explicit error messages in case a plugin is not found.
- Add file TGeoUnits.h, which allows to use the "usual SystemOfUnits"
    from CLHEP using TGeo with the namespace tgeo::xxx
```
    Example: tgeo::mm -> 0.1 (Geant3: cm, sec,  GeV, degree)
                 ::mm -> 1.0 (Geant4: mm, nsec, MeV, radian)
    I hope I got all translations right.
    Geant4                                   Geant3
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    millimeter         mm=1,cm=10            centimeter  mm=0.1,cm=1
    nanosecond         s=1e9                 second      ns=1e-9,s=1
    Mega electron Volt GeV=1e3               GeV         GeV=1
    radian             rad=1                 degree      rad=180/pi

    Unclear to me was if in Geant3 steradian is also 2*2*pi or 2*2*180 degree.
```


* F. Gaede
- changes to build system:
         (see ReadMe.txt for details)

- moved examples to ./example directory   
- they are not built as part of dd4hep anymore

- install thisdd4hep.sh in ./bin
           (modified to have the correct pathes) 

- added -DINSTALL_DOC=on/off option
           to build doxygen documentation (in ./doc/html/index.html)

- create DD4hepConfig.cmake for easy building against dd4hep
           ( see examples CMakeLists.txt)

- fixed doxygen API documentation (C.Rosemann)
          (greatly improved with many graphs)

# v00-04
* F. Gaede
- placement options are now compatible with geant4 
- fixed Geant4SensitiveDetector::getVolumeID()
- modified ILDEx model to not use assemblies (for now !?)
- removed obsolete geant4 example ILDEx
- Fix population procedure of volume manager
- Fix uniqueness of volume identifiers.
- Remove call with lookups by placed volume to the volume manager
- improved ILDEx toy example:	   		
  - fixed creation of cellIDS for simhits
  - creates SimTrackerHits for VXD, SIT and TPC
    - creates SimCalorimeterHits for AHcal barrele and endcap
    - works now wigth ILDExSimu _and_ SLIC if no assemblies are used
    - assemblies work with the dd4hep Geant4Converter and VolumeManager
  - added a prototype example for a ROOT independent 
              plugin mechanism for SensitiveDetectors
  - added example implemetation for Calice test beam
          calorimeters: CaliceTbeam  (Shaojun Lu, DESY)


* 2013/21/06    Markus Frank
- Since the placement model for combined translations and rotations
      caused more confusion than good, it was agreed to move to a more
      Geant4 like placement model using Vectors, Rotations and Transformations
      from ROOT::Math. To place a physical volume only one of these
      is allowed as an argument: either a rotation or a translation
      for simple placements. Combinations may be constructed with Transform3D
      objects allowing more complicated placements.
      The same mechanism was applied for the operations to construct
      boolean solids.
- The CLICSid Examples were updated according to the changes necessary
      from 1)
- The Tesla drivers from the ILDExDet example were removed. They are
      not compliant to 1).
- The G4 package allows now to translate TGeo geometries to Geant4.
      Visual inspection has shown an agreement between the two geometries.
- The TGeo to Detector/GDML conversion is still buggy. Hence, simulations
      using slic as an engine do not yet work. This is being looked at.

   IMPORTANT NOTICE:
   The changes described in above may affect existing detector constructors.
   Unless all problems are solved you should be careful to move to the svn
   head. In any case save your checkout or use the tag v00-03.

 

# v00-03
- broken geometry (for some rotations/translations)
- 'backup release' before placement options 
   will be reduced

# v00-02
* 2013/02/06    Markus Frank
- Simplyfy inheritance for common objects from TNamed.
     Use direct inheritance of Object from TNamed rather than hidden 
     using the Value<a,b> construct.
- Added physical volume manager to simplyfy the detector element 
     and sensitive detector lookup from a given physical volume.
     This implies: If the volume manager is instantiated, the readout specifiers
     MUST be correct. This is in most xml files NOT the case.
     The "system" field holding the sibdetector-id is MANDATORY!
     Otherwise you will receive messages like this:

     Exception:SITCollection: This ID descriptor has no field with the name:CellID0
               while programming VolumeManager. Are your volIDs correct?

- To check the volume identification, add argument -volmgr to geoConverter,
     geoDisplay, etc.
- To trace possible memory leaks:
     export DD4HEP_TRACE=Yes
     then run you converter etc. At the end a table is displayed with a "leakage"
     column, showing how many objects were not deleted.

```
- Prenotice:
     As soon as ROOT v 6.00 is out, we will have to use it!
     Andrei kindly agreed to implement a few changes to TGeo, which will make 
     life much easier and the implementation cleaner and less cumbersome.


# v00-01
* 2013/20/03    Markus Frank
- Finished the compact->description converter
     Extract description information
```
      $ > geoConverter -compact2description -input file:<compact-input-xml-file> -output <detector>.description
      $ > <SimDist>/scripts/slic.sh -o output.slcio -g SiD.description -m <geant4-macro>.mac -r 100 
```

- Finished the compact->gdml converter
  Full GDML cycle can be tested (deplace <detector> with some meaningful identifier):
  - Extract gdml information
      `$ > geoConverter -compact2gdml -input file:<compact-input-xml-file> -output <detector>.gdml`
  - Extract visualisation hints to csv file
      `$ > geoConverter -compact2vis -input file:<compact-input-xml-file> -output <detector>.vis.csv -ascii`
  - Load GDML into ROOT:
      `$ > root.exe ../doc/gdml_root.C+\(\"<detector>\"\)`
      The macro expects *at least* the <detector>.gdml file. If no visualisation
      information is found, the resulting graphics however is not very nice!
 

* 2013/22/02    Markus Frank
- Today a decision was taken to remove all _X() and _A() macros 
  accessing static unicode strings. A common macro will be used to
  address both XML elements and XML attributes using the macro _U(...).
  The original usage only created confusion.
  All _X and _A macros were replaced by _U.

- Improve the executables running the plugin mechanism in UtitlityApps.
  They now complain if the plugin was not found.


* 2013/21/02    Markus Frank
- Require strict checks for the existence of xml attributes.
  e.g. default=false for Element::attr<bool>() is no longer an option.
  if the attribute is not present in the element, an exception
  is thrown.

- Slightly change the factory method for creating detector elements.
  Use a more generic pattern do support also more generic XML 
  processing.

* 2013/20/02    Markus Frank
- Install rootmap mechanism for the usage of plugins.
  It is no longer necessary to have separate programs
  for the various detector models (ILD/SiD).
  One generic display program servest them all.
  ==> Creation of package DDExamples/UtilityApps
  example: $> bin/displayGeo -compact <compact-xml-file>

- This move has another consequence:
  All libraries are build into a common install area:
  the <build directory>/lib.
  All executable binaries are build into a common install area:
  the <build directory>/bin.

- The LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH variables as defined in 
  'thisdd4hep.(c)sh' do include these directories

* 2013/20/02    Markus Frank
- dd4hep release notes. Better start them late than never.
  If you perform significant changes to the dd4hep core,
  plase leave a small notice here.
