  -  Fix bug in Alignment test:
     - A long standing bug was fixed for the test `t_AlignDet_Telescope_align_new`.
     - It was assumed that the `DetElements` were ordered in memory, which is **not** true (probably due to memory randomization).
     - Moved to path dependent ordering. Test now OK.
     - Closes #282 
  
  -  Removed a Bunch of `rootcling` warnings
     - Apparently `rootcling` now expects a class with the name of the dictionary header file.
     - To satify this some dummy anonymous classes were added.
     - Closes #290

  - Add possibility to parse `XML` from string
    - Please see  #288 for details.
    - The main interface was not changed. Rather a view to the Detector class supports this functionality.
     - The existing view `dd4hep::DetectorLoad` was enhanced to allow the required functionality:
     ```cpp
      Detector detector = ....;
      /// So here is the actual test: We parse the raw XML string
      DetectorLoad loader(detector);
      loader.processXMLString(buffer,0);
     ```
     - An example was added (`ClientTests/src/XML_InMemory.cpp`, which illustrates the usage).
  
  - Improve DDCond manual
    - Improve that the DDCond manual reflects the source code.
    - The possible plugins provided are not all described. This shall be future work.
  
  - Enable the GDML reader plugin
    - Closes #275

  ### DDG4 enhancements
  - Enable framework support in DDG4. The `Geant4Context` is the main thread specific accessor to the `dd4hep`, `DDG4` and the user framework.
      - The access to the `dd4hep` objects is via the `Geant4Context::detectorDescription()` call,
      - the access to `DDG4` as a whole is supported via `Geant4Context::kernel()` and
      - the access to the user gframework using a specialized implementation of:
      `template <typename T> T& userFramework()  const;`
   
      A user defined implementations must be specialized somewhere in a compilation unit of the user framework, not in a header file. The framework object could host e.g. references for histogramming, logging, data access etc.
    
      This way any experiment/user related data processing framework can exhibit it's essential tools to `DDG4` actions.
    
      A possible specialized implementations would look like the following:
    ```cpp
      struct Gaudi  {
        IMessageSvc*   msg;
        IHistogramSvc* histos;
        ....
      };
      template<> Gaudi& Geant4Context::userFramework<Gaudi>()  const  {
        UserFramework& fw = m_kernel->userFramework();
        if ( fw.first && &typeid(T) == fw.second ) return *(T*)fw.first;
        throw std::runtime_error("No user specified framework context present!");
      }
    ```  
      To access the user framework then use the following call:
      ```cpp
      Gaudi* fw = context->userFramework<Gaudi>();
      ```
      of course after having initialized it:
    ```cpp
      Gaudi * fw = ...;
      GaudiKernel& kernel = ...;
      kernel.setUserFramework(fw);
    ```
  
  - `G4RunManager` is now a plugin. To enable user defined run managers in `DDG4`, the run manager is encapsulated in a `Geant4Action`. See `DDG4/plugins/Geant4RunManagers.cpp` how to implement such plugins. Currently there are to factories implemented: 
     -  `G4RunManager` -> factory invokes the single threaded `G4RunManager`
     -  `G4MTRunManager `-> factory invokes the multi threaded `G4MTRunManager`
  
    The factory names here are identical to the names of the native G4 classes.

* 2017-11-30 Marko Petric ([PR#268](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/268))
  - Introduce new DD4hep web-site: http://dd4hep.cern.ch/

  - Update of LHeD example - overlaps (problem with SubdetectorAssembly)

* 2017-12-01 Markus Frank ([PR#275](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/275))
  - Add Support to Export and Import GDML Data
    - Allow extorts and imports of partial geometry trees with GDML. **This requires however a future version of ROOT**, since some changes were necessary in the ROOT GDML handlers. The code is commented out for the time being. The plugin implementation is in `DDCore/src/gdml/GdmlPlugin.cpp`
  - Remove print statements from DDG4 scripts
     - Replace prints with calls to the python logging utility. Hopefully this shall give at some point python3 compatibility.
  - Update `G4Stepper` factories
    - Add some missing steppers

* 2017-12-01 Marko Petric ([PR#274](https://github.com/aidasoft/dd4hep/pull/274))
  - Revert `DDG4.py` Geant4 initialization parameters back to values specified in Geant4 (see discussion #266)

# v01-05

# v01-04

* 2017-10-17 Markus Frank ([PR#248](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/248))
  ### VolumeManager Implementation
  A possibly important bug was fixed for the lookup of top level subdetectors in the `VolumeManager` by volume identifers of (sensitive) volumes. Due to a bug in the de-masking possible wrong top level subdetectors were returned. The default use cases typically do not use this call and hence should not be affected.

* 2017-10-17 Shaojun Lu ([PR#247](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/247))
  - Fix C++11 pointer error by adding include <memory> for 'unique_ptr' (GCC 4.9).

* 2017-10-13 Marko Petric ([PR#246](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/246))
  ### DDCMS:
  - Improve the CMS excercise. New examples etc.
  - Support for simulation using DDG4 (at least partially - since not all subdetector volumes are accepted by Geant4).
  
  ### DDG4:
  - Event reader returns `EVENT_READER_EOF` if `EOF` is detected rather than a generic IO error.
  - Add generator status word to the `Geant4Particle` object. Remove the extension mechanism, which is very heavy to just add one integer.
  
  ### General:
   - We need to distinguish the plugins using some namespace mechanism. I started to introduce the namespace separator `"_".` Hence all DD4hep plugins start with `DD4hep_<plugin>`. I hope this does not break everything. If it does, please notify me and we can undo.

* 2017-10-13 Whitney Armstrong ([PR#243](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/243))
  - Added helper function `getAttrOrDefault` (defined in  `DDCore/include/XML/Helper.h`) 
   This  function `getAttrOrDefault(xml::Element e, xml::XmlChar attr_name, T default_value)` will return the attribute  name,  converted to to type `T` but if it is not found it will return `default_value`. When building new detectors supplying this is useful for supplying default attribute values.

* 2017-10-19 Markus Frank ([PR#249](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/249))
  * Improve the CMS tracker visualisation
  * Add DDG4 simulation example to DDCMS
  * Add some plugins to add visualisation attributes if required (not for the compact description)

* 2017-11-01 David Blyth ([PR#254](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/254))
  - DDG4/python/DDG4.py: loadDDG4() changed to not raise exception if libraries are already loaded

* 2017-11-01 David Blyth ([PR#252](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/252))
  - Added requirement of Python 2 in cmake/FindPYTHON.cmake.  This makes clear the requirement of Python 2, and resolves the issue where CMake tries to build with Python 3 in a system where both exist.

* 2017-11-07 Frank Gaede ([PR#256](https://github.com/aidasoft/DD4hep/pull/256))
  - bug fix in `BitField64::operator[std::string]() `
  - make uses of TString in DocumentHandler.cpp compatible with clang9 (on Mac)

# v01-03

* 2017-10-12 Frank Gaede ([PR#244](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/244))
  - allow for unbounded surfaces in DDRec
       - add new property `SurfaceType::Unbounded`
       - if a surface is marked unbounded `Surface::insideBounds()` ignores the volume boundaries (and only checks the distance to the surface)

* 2017-09-19 Whitney Armstrong ([PR#233](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/233))
  - Added helper  `CellIDPositionConverter::cellDimensions(const CellID& cell)`

* 2017-10-09 Frank Gaede ([PR#242](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/242))

  - use as `const` everywhere
  - re-implement `BitField64` using `BitFieldCoder`
    - is thread safe if used locally 
    - can be instantiated from `const BitFieldCoder*`

  - Created a new example showing the CMS tracking detector
    - Get CMS going with their evaluation. Added a package DDCMS with the conversion plugins for the silicon trackers and the corresponding conversion mechanism for their `xml` structure.

* 2017-09-18 Frank Gaede ([PR#232](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/232))
  - fix reading of stdhep/lcio generator files with generator statuses not in [0,3]
  - add `G4PARTICLE_GEN_BEAM` and `G4PARTICLE_GEN_OTHER` to DDG4
    -  `G4PARTICLE_GEN_BEAM`  is generally agreed to be used for beam particles (HepMC, LCIO)
    -  all other status codes vary from generator to generator and we use OTHER
  - for stdhep or lcio input the true generator status is preserved in the lcio output, regardless of its value
  - create a vertex for every parent-less particle in LCIOEventReader
    - this allows for example to read GuineaPig files ( non-prompt pair particles) or special user created files with non-prompt particles
   - Resolves #101

* 2017-09-20 Markus Frank ([PR#235](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/235))
  - A more complete version of the CMS tracker
     - Enhanced the CMS tracker example to be more complete.
     - Stopped at some point to convert all CMS algorithms. Hence, the tracker is not complete, but the remaining work looks to be purely mechanical.

* 2017-10-02 Frank Gaede ([PR#239](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/239))
  - add cell sizes to printout of `LayeredCalorimeterData::layer`

  - add ncellsX/Y as a "parameter", allowing it to be set in compact description. This change is for easier use in the case of a MultiSegmentation. (Only a uniform segmentation can be defined in this way: for more complex cases, must set by driver.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  - change from array to std::vector to store ncells information

  ## Implement ROOT persistency mechanism for detector descriptions (continuation of AIDASoft/DD4hep#202).
  Object extensions are now persistent.                                                                   
                                                                                                          
  This is however not for free: **it requires a dictionary for the extension itself and it requires a dictionary for the class holding the extension**. These are:
   - `dd4hep::DetElement::DetElementExtension<IFACE,CONCRETE>` for `DetElement` extensions.                                                                       
   - `dd4hep::SimpleExtension<IFACE,CONCRETE>` for simple extension managed by the user framework (user calls explicitly destructor).                             
   - `dd4hep::DeleteExtension<IFACE,CONCRETE>` for simple extension managed by dd4hep (dd4hep calls automatically destructor on hosting object destruction).      
   - `dd4hep::CopyDeleteExtension<IFACE,CONCRETE>`. As above, but these extensions support calling the copy constructor of the embedded object and hence allow to copy also the hosting objects.
                                                                                                                                                                                                
  Please note: to persistify these objects it was necessary to no longer use the type-info of the objects as an identifier, but rather a 64-bit-hash of the raw type-info-name. This relies that this name is identical across platforms. This typically is true for linux, but not enforced by any standard.

  ## Implement ROOT persistency mechanism for detector descriptions              
                                                                                 
  The following commits allow to save and restore Detector objects (ie. the full detector description) to/from ROOT. Most changes affected the usage of void pointers. 
                                                                                                                                                                       
  It is **NOT** possible to:                                                                                                                                           
   * save object extensions. Another usage of void pointers and type-info objects, which both cannot be saved.                                                         
   * save callback objects. Callbacks store in memory pointers to member functions. These depend on the loading of libraries at run-time and hence may differ from application to application.
   * save conditions slices. This shall be a futute extension. There should be no fundamental problem doing so - it was simply not yet done.                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                              
  In the example area a new slot call "Persistency" was created with various tests:                                                                                                           
   * Save and restore simple conditions                                                                                                                                                       
   * Save and restore the MiniTel detector (`examples/ClientTests/compact/MiniTel.xml`)                                                                                                       
   * Save and restore the CLICSiD detector (`examples/CLICSiD/compact/compact.xml`)                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                              
  The detector examples also have a set of tests associated to check the validity of the restored information.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                              
  ## Integrate `DDSegmentatation` into `DDCore`                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                              
  As a first step to start the cleanup of `DDSegmentation` the code was integrated into `DDCore`. For backwards compatibility a dummy library `libDDSegmentation.so` is kept, so that client cmake files directly referring `DDSegmentation` still work. **This tough is only a temporary measure and users should remove references to the DDSegmentation library.** Include files can be accessed as before. These are part of the `DDCore` include directory.

  Conditions slices from the DD4hep conditions store can now be saved to ROOT files ans named objects. Conditions persistency examples are added to the `examples/Conditions` section.
  The examples are derived from the Telescope and CLICSiD example:

  A cast problem was not spotted in the last commit, which manifested itself in accessing invalid materials from volumes. This commit resolves #211 , reported by @jhrdinka.          
                                                                                                                                                                                      
  A set of tests checks this behaviour in the ClientTests: `ClientTests_volume_materials_<text>`, where the volume tree is scanned and for all sensitive volumes and access the corresponding `materials/TGeoMedium` entities from the volume object.

   - The entire `IOV` indexed pool set (class `ConditionsIOVPool`) or                                                                                                                                                                        
   - A the pool used by a `ConditionsSlice` (class `UserPool`).
   - A std::vector<Condition> which belong all to the same IOV

  In any case the restoration of the saved conditions is performed through the `ConditionsManager` interface in order to ensure proper management of the added condition objects.

  Some example plugin tasks were added in examples/Conditions:
   - `DD4hep_ConditionExample_save` to save conditions to a ROOT file.
   - `DD4hep_ConditionExample_load` to restore conditions from file.

  Others to come.

  ## Split of dictionary files
  The ROOT dictionary creation in `DDCore` was getting increasingly large. Now the ROOT dictionaries are created in several files, what firstly allows them to be produced in parallel and secondly eases the compilation due to smaller generated file sizes.

  ## DDCore: Changes to the VolumeManager interface
  
    Recent descrepancies showed that the call to lookup a placement
    from the volume manager may have an ambiguous meaning:
    It may (as used until now) be the placement of thge closest
    detector element - a functionality used by various tests
    or be the placement of the sensitive volume itself.
    So far, since each sensitive volume in the DD4hep tests
    is represented by a DetElement structure, both
    approaches returned the same placed volume.
  
    Since there is the possibility to have sensitive volumes, which are not
    directly connected to a single DetElement structure, this call was
    split to resolve this ambiguity:
  
    /// Lookup a physical (placed) volume identified by its 64 bit hit ID
    PlacedVolume lookupVolumePlacement(VolumeID volume_id) const;
    /// Lookup a physical (placed) volume of the detector element
    /// containing a volume identified by its 64 bit hit ID
    PlacedVolume lookupDetElementPlacement(VolumeID volume_id) const;

  ## DD4hep namespace reorganization
  
  Re-organize namespaces according to the decisions of the DD4hep developers meeting from 16th June we have decided:
  
  1. all namespaces will be lower case and shorter
      * rename namespace `DD4hep` -> `dd4hep`
      * rename namespace `DD4hep::DDRec` -> `dd4hep::rec`
      * rename namespace `DD4hep::Simulation` -> `dd4hep::sim`
      * rename namespace `XML` -> `xml` and `JSON` -> `json`
      * rename all other namespaces according to this pattern
  2. The namespace `DD4hep::Geometry::` will be incorporated into `dd4hep::`
  3. All utilities will be moved `dd4hep::detail`
  4. `LCDD` will be renamed to `Detector` and current `Detector.h` will be renamed to `DetElement.h`
  8. Examine if `DDSegmentation` can be incorporated into `DDCore` and make it volume aware
      * If this this cannot be achieved in whole place `DDSegmentation` into the right namespace
  
    ## DDParsers
  
    DDParsers are now a separate package. This does not make it yet standalone,
    but it is at the same level as e.g. DDSeqmentation. Any librarian is
    encouraged to externialize it fully.

# v00-24

* 2017-06-08 Markus Frank ([PR#160](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/160))
  * Add a new class `AlignmentsNominalMap`, which behaves like a `ConditionsMap` and handles alignment entries. 
  * The `AlignmentsNominalMap` is not a conditions cache per-se. This implementation  behaves like a `conditionsmap`, but it shall not return real conditions to the user, but rather return the default alignment objects (which at the basis are conditions as well) to the user. These alignments are taken from the `DetElement` in question `Alignment DetElement::nominal()`.
  
  * The basic idea is to enable users to write code "as if" there would be conditions present. This is important to ease in the lifetime of the experiment the step from the design phase (where obviously no conditions are taken into account) to a more mature phase, where alignment studies etc. actually are part of the "bread and butter work".
  
  * Added a corresponding example in examples/AlignDet:
  ```
  $>   geoPluginRun -volmgr -destroy -plugin DD4hep_AlignmentExample_nominal \
           -input file:${DD4hep_DIR}/examples/AlignDet/compact/Telescope.xml
  ```
     * Access the DetElement nominal conditions using the `AlignmentNominalMap`.
     Any use of DDCond is inhibited.
       1) We use the generic printer, which during the detector element scan accesses the conditions map.
       2) We use a delta scanner to extract the nominal deltas from the `DetElement`'s nominal alignments
       3) We use a `ConditionsTreeMap` to perform the alignments re-computation.

* 2017-06-08 Markus Frank ([PR#159](https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/pull/159))
  # Implementation of the decisions made at the Conditions mini-workshop
  
  ## Access mechanisms of DD4hep conditions for utilities
  
  Access to conditions is solely supported using the interface class DDCore/ConditionsMap.
  * All utilities must use this interface.
  * Any concrete implementation using conditions/alignment utilities must implement this interface
  * Basic implementation using STL `map`, `multimap` and `unordered_map` are provided.
  * A special no-op implementation of this interface shall be provided to access "default" alignment conditions. This implementation shall fall-back internally to the `DetElement::nominal()` alignment. 
  Known clients: `VolumeManager` (hence: DDG4, DDRec, etc.)
  
  Though this sounds like a trivial change, the consequences concern the entire conditions
  and alignment handling. This interface decouples entirely the core part of DD4hep
  from the conditions cache handling and the alignment handling.
  
  Based on this interface most utilities used to handle conditions, detectors scans
  to visit `DetElement` related condition sets, alignment and conditions printers etc.
  
  For details, please see:
  ```
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/AlignmentsPrinter.h
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/AlignmentsProcessor.h
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/ConditionsPrinter.h
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/ConditionsProcessor.h
  DDCore/include/DD4hep/DetectorProcessor.h
  ```
  
  ## Naming conventions for detector conditions
  
  * Condition are logically attached to DetElements
     * Condition names are: `DetElement.path()+"#"+condition-name`
         Example: `/world/LHCb/DownstreamRegion/Muon/M5/M5ASide/R3ASide/Cham046#alignment`
  
  * Condition keys are a `int64` compound of two `int32`:
  ```cpp
     union {
       int64 key;
       struct {
         int32 item_key;
         int32 det_key;     // Needs to be the high word to have a properly ordered map
       } values;
     };
     det_key  = hash32(DetElement.path())
     item_key = hash32(condition-name)
  ```
     **Condition keys must be unique throughout the detector description.**
  
  * Alignment conditions naming conventions:
    * Alignment-delta conditions are called `alignment_delta`.
    * Fully qualified alignment conditions are called `alignment`.
     DD4hep provided alignment utilities rely on this convention.
  
  * Other conditions can be named freely.
  
  ## Important Notice
  The **Alignment conditions naming conventions** are already used by several utilities involving alignments. If you plan to use these, do not freely ignore these recommendations. When the naming conventions are ignored, these utilities shall not work.
  
  ## Updates to DDCond
  DDCond implements a working conditions cache following the design criteria sketched above. The `conditionsSlice` object implements (though by forwarding to the `ConditionsUserPool`) a `ConditionsMap` interface.
  
  The `DD4hep_ConditionsMapUserPool` plugin implements in a very efficient way this interface using an ordered map. Using the above described key definition, this implementation allows very efficient scans of conditions/alignments etc. of individual detector elements, since conditions which belong to the same detector element are contiguous.
  
  ## Alignment handling/computations
  Using the conditions maps, the computation of (mis-)alignment data from deltas
  is no longer bound to the conditions mechanisms.
  
  A special utility called `AlignmentsCalculator` is put in place (see `DDCore/include/DD4hep/AlignmentsCalculator.h`) to facilitate the computation of a coherent set of alignments given a set of delta-parameters. This mechanism is much simpler, easier to understand and far less code intensive than the previously designed callback mechanism where alignments are obtained using conditions derivation.
  
  ## Update of the existing examples
  
  The example sets in DDDB, `examples/Conditions, examples/AlignDet`, `examples/DDDB` were updated according to the changed mechanism of accessing conditions. Here we can see the real benefits of the new approach: keeping same functionality, the examples became way off simpler. Simply count the number of lines of code.

  Improvements to the compact xml processing
  ===========================================
  
  Elements may now be specified within compact in 2 ways:
  1) old way: create an effective element:
  `    <element Z="4" formula="Be" name="Be" >`
  `      <atom type="A" unit="g/mol" value="9.01218" />`
  `    </element>`
  
  2) create element by defining an isotope mixture:
  `    <isotope name="C12" Z="6" N="12"/>`
  `      <atom unit="g/mole" value="xxxx"/>`
  `    </isotope>`
  `.....`
  `   <element name="C">`
  `     <fraction n="0.9893" ref="C12"/>`
  `     <fraction n="0.0107" ref="C13"/>`
  `   </element>`
  
  Improved debugging of compact xml conversions
  The following tags allow to enable increased prinout depending on additional tags in the compact file:
  `    <debug>`
  `      <type name="isotopes"     value="1"/>`
  `      <type name="elements"     value="1"/>`
  `      <type name="materials"    value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="visattr"      value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="regions"      value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="readout"      value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="limits"       value="0"/>`
  `      <type name="segmentation" value="0"/>`
  `    </debug>`
  
  Disable the ROOT TGeo element table from the compact xml. 
  Note: ALL elements must then be specified in the XML material database.
  `    <geometry>`
  `      <clear name="elements"/>`
  `    </geometry>`
  
  By default compact accepts exactly one input file (others may be included therein).
  In order to process iteratively multiple input files, the opening and the closing of the
  geometry steering tags may be added to the compact description. This example 
  gives the default behaviour:
  `    <geometry open="true" close="true"/>`
  
  Please note: per compact file exactly ONE geometry tag is allowed.
  
  
  Debugging the DDG4 geometry conversion mechanism
  =============================================
  New boolean properties of the Geant4DetectorGeometryConstruction object,
  which result in debugging printouts (defaults are OFF):
    DebugMaterials
    DebugElements
    DebugShapes
    DebugVolumes
    DebugPlacements
    DebugRegions
    PrintPlacements
    PrintSensitives

    system:16,barrel:16:-5
    
* 2016-10-18 M.Frank
-  Due to pressure of the FCC folks, I tried to implement a more dd4hep like implementation of the
  the segmentation objects. For testing only CartesianGridXY. If this mechanism works,
  it could be a starting recipe for the rest of the segmentations. The draw-back of this approach is,
  that assignments are not reversible:
  dd4hep::CartesianGridXY xy = readout.segmentation();  // Works
  dd4hep::Segmentation seg = xy;                    // Should not work

-  Reason: the managed objects are different....at some point in time I will have to find a
  clean solution for this, but the required changes for such a solution shall be manageable.

# v00-17

* 2016-09-29 V.Volkl
  - Small fixes and extensions of DDEve. Show "Views" menu even if specifying xml on the command line.
    Add possibility to specify event data in EveDisplay method, rather than having to select it in the gui dialogue.
    Selects FCC EventHandler if specified in the config xml (as an "eventHandler"-attribute to the "display" node),
    but keeps default behavior if not.


* 2016-08-24 M.Frank
      - Adding first somehow useful implementation to use conditions and the consequent loading thereof.
	Used by the DDDB implementation/example. DDDB is an alternative way to populate the dd4hep
	detector description using LHCb's detector description database.
	The reason is, that only a running experiment has a reasonable base to conditions data
	to excercise the dd4hep conditions.
	If interested, please have a look in the DDDB examples.

  - Still TODO:
    - A formal way to bootstrap the conditions loading still has to be found.
    - Conditions loading from XML files and a small comprehensive example.

# v00-16
* 2016-07-26 Shaojun Lu  
- Added new MegatileLayerGridXY segmentation for Scintillator strip Ecal, which is implemented by K.Kotera, 
 and used by SEcal04Hybrid geometry driver.

* 2016-06-24 M.Frank
- Implement multiple segmentations.
  Though one readout objects (associated to one DetElement) may only have on segmentation,
  The MultiSegmentation type allows to have several sub-segmentations, which can be chosen
  from.
  Please see examples/ClientTests/*/MultiSegmentations

- At the same time allow the readout object to defined multiple collections through
  the IDDescriptor.
  Please see examples/ClientTests/*/MultiCollections

- The combined example can be found in
  Please see examples/ClientTests/*/NestedSegmentations



* 2016-05-03 M.Frank
- Green light is ON. You may use revision 2237 and above.

* 2016-05-03 M.Frank
- **Mega commit. Do not use until green signal arrives with seperate release notice.**
- Package DDDB: Prove of concept, that we can populate the geometry also from other
  sources than xml files obeying the lccdd notation.
- DDCore/XML: Implement the possibility to use external entity resolution for Xerces.
  There is not equivalent in TinyXML (AFAIK).
- Remove some of the Spirit parsers, since the libraries are getting way too big.
  This implicitly assumes, that object properties of 'exotic' types such as
  deque<long double> etc. are not really used. If you need properties stay to the obvious:
  string, int float, double and vectors, maps and sets thereof!
- DDG4 needed to public the DDG4Python include directory (Now in DDG4/Python).
  Reason: try to create ROOT 6 dictionaries, which can be relocated for release purposes.
- ROOT 6 dictionary generation: Create dictionaries with the additional flag:
  "-inlineInputHeader" which physically includes the header files used to generate the 
  dictionaries --> relocatability.

* 2016-03-21 M.Frank
- Add additional vertex argument to EventReader::readParticles, which supposedly should

  flat in : uniform, cos(theta), eta/pseudorapidity, ffbar (1+cos^2 theta)
  Option: generator.Distribution = 'cos(theta)'
  Default is uniform.

* 2015-12-09 N.Nikiforou
- UtilityApps/teveDisplay
  - Modified teveDisplay to have three separate collections of surface vectors (u,v,n) 
    instead of one collection. Now the vectors are colored differently.
  - Changed signature of getSurfaceVectors() to allow selection of o,u,v,n vectors to 
    add to the collection, added option for name and color of collection.

- DDG4
  - Extend the functionality of the DDG4 plugins
    Geant4InteractionVertexBoost and Geant4InteractionVertexSmear.
    If the Mask property is set to -1, all interactions present
    at call time are smeared/boosted according to the parameters.
    Note, that the position of the plugins within the generation 
    sequence is important.
  - Add a new generator Geant4GeneratorWrapper to allow the use
    of native G4 generator classes such as the G4ParticleGun or
    the G4GeneralParticleSource. Still to be tested.
  - Extend the Geant4Random functionality: May now be instantiated
    like any other Geant4Action. Users may set the seed or the 
    luxury level.

-  added starter docs dd4hepStartersGuide.pdf

*** **Important** ***
  **Before updating, backup your existing and working checkout. Though I was running 
  the basic tests, there may be unchecked corners of the software.**

Notes:
- Backwards compatibility mode for the usage of ROOT 5 and ROOT 6 alternatively.
- For ROOT 6 the Gaudi PluginService is used and added to the distribution.
- dd4hep is distributed with a licence. See $DD4hepINSTALL/LICENSE for details.
- In the doc area the $DD4hepINSTALL/doc/CREDITS file everybode should add her/his 
  name, if contributed significantly.
- Unfortunately this meant to add/change the headers of all files and give a 
  pointer to the licence file. If I accidentally changed the author name, please
  chagne it back.
- The plugin factory declaration statements were changed to accomodate both
  ROOT 5 and ROOT 6 and to keep the number of 'ifdef' statements at a minimum.
- TODO: Properly change the cmake scripts to accomodate for ROOT 6 and the 
  automatic switch when building dd4hep. 
- For reference reasons: this commits is revision 1812 + 1813 (DDDetectors)

* 2014/09/26 Markus Frank
- Quite some effort to improve the doxygen documentation.
  The current revision is can be found at:

* 2014/02/06 Markus Frank
- DDDetectors: Add example surface plugin with arguments.
    - example code: DDDetectors/src/SurfaceExamplePlugin.cpp
    - compact:
```   
       <plugin name="DD4hep_SurfaceExamplePlugin">
          <argument value="SiTrackerBarrel"/>
          <argument value="aa=1*mm"/>
          <argument value="bb=2*cm"/>
          <argument value="cc=3*m"/>
       </plugin>
```

    - output:
    
```cpp
    SurfaceExamplePlugin: argument[0] = SiTrackerBarrel value = -1
    SurfaceExamplePlugin: argument[1] = aa=1*mm value = 0.1
    SurfaceExamplePlugin: argument[2] = bb=2*cm value = 2
    SurfaceExamplePlugin: argument[3] = cc=3*m value = 300
```

- DDG4: Impreoved LCIO handling for DDG4
- DDG4: Input handling:
  - LCIO input file reading with multiple *independent* inputs
    to support overlay, multiple interactions, etc.
  - Primary verex smearing independent for each input
  - Primary vertex boosts independent for each input
- DDG4: Output handling
  - MC Particle handling
  - Improved MC truth handling for produced Hits.
    Still needs revisiting.

# v00-10

  ( both have the wrong version number for the libraries 0.7 !)
- added ./doc/prepare_a_release.howto
- added new method to BitField64: setValue(unsigned lowWord, unsigned highWord )
 - added some simple unit tests for BitField64


* 2014/08/15 Markus Frank
- DDG4 Add possibility for user hook to the particle handler +
  Data member to store additionbal particle data for the
  output stage.
- Allow to display MC particles in DDEve
  Add small help file describing how to start DDEve.
  doc/DDEveManual.pdf
- Update CLICSiD Example.

# v00-09      
* 2014/08/07 Markus Frank

  particle filtering to optimize the size of the MC record.
- DDG4 fix SimpleCalorimter sensitive action and properly support
  hit aggregations.
- DDEve smaller modifications to support DDG4IO if dd4hep was 
  built with the Geant4 option ON.

# v00-08

  - add Bitflag to store CellID1 in SimCalorimeterHit collections
  - fix position conversion from Geant4 to ROOT
  - add cellID determination to SensitiveAction
  - ...


* Andre Sailer, 2014-07-17
- Unify cmake option variables, small cmake corrections
- Change options `_WITH_` to `_USE_`
- Print Warning that variables with `_WITH_` are deprecated
- Change Defintions to `_USE_` as well
- Add REQUIRED to find_package geant4 and xercesc if they are turned on
- Updated documentation
- Updated ILDExDet example

* Christian.Grefe, 2014-07-15
- Made DDSegmentation optionally a stand-alone package
  create DDSgementationConfig.cmake when build as part of dd4hep

* Markus Frank, 2014-07-02
- add LCIO conversions from DDSim - sensitive detectors 
  can now simply instantiate LCIO Sim hits
  
* 2014/06/30 Markus Frank
- DDG4: Support user (context-) extensions for Geant4.
  User contexts are availible for events and runs. The contexts
  are accessible from the Geant4Context meber of each Geant4Action,
  the base class for all processing entities.
   - Adding a context:
```
      context()->event().addExtension(pointer_to_object, typeid(TYPE), 0);
      or 
      context()->event().addExtension<TYPE>(pointer_to_object);
      In the first case the object is NOT DELETED at the end of the event.
      In the second case the object is deleted.
```      
    - Accessing the context:
```    
          TYPE* ctx = context()->event().extension<TYPE>(false);
      The boolean argument indicates if an exception should be thrown
      if the extension is not present ie. here no exception.
```      
- DDCore: adjust a few print statements.

* 2014/06/27 Markus Frank
- Separate XML loading from Detector implementation.
- New package: DDEve: a bit more sophisticated TEve specialization
- To start use examples/CLICSiD/compact/DDEve.xml
- DDEve can interface currently to ROOT files created by DDG4.
- An example data file is provided as well in:
- examples/CLICSiD/compact/CLICSiD_events.root
- Documentation is lacking a bit....
- start the display with: `$> root.exe ${DD4hepINSTALL}/examples/DDEve/DDEve.C`


* 2014/06/19 Frank Gaede
- replaced TGeoUnits.h by  DD4hepUnits.h
- renamed namespace tgeo to dd4hep -> users need to replace tgeo::mm by dd4hep::mm


* 2014/06/12 Frank Gaede
- changed default unit for angles to be radians   (tgeo::rad = 1.)
- enforce usage of units from TGeoUnits.h in xml expression evaluators
- convert to degrees for angles in TGeoShapes constructors
- NB: there is one inconsistency left here:  angles returned
  from TGeoShapes are already in degrees, this is the one
  case where a quantity returned from dd4hep/TGeo does not have the default
  units - thus one should not write
  
 ` double phi = coneSeg.Phi1() / tgeo::rad ;`
 
  but rather
  
  `double phi = coneSeg.Phi1() * tgeo::deg ;`


* 2014/06/03 Markus Frank
- Provision for ROOT persistency for dd4hep detector descriptions:
  Create Cint dictionary for dd4hepCore by default when building the library.
  For the time being the area of DDSegmentation is left out, since these
  objects require changes due to the handling of references and template
  specializations. Besides these, dd4hep detector descriptions can be
  saved and read-back directly to/from ROOT files - which may improve
  a lot the startup time of processes.

- The DDG4 dictionary is created by default when building the library.
  When importing DDG4 from python only the dd4hepCore dd4hepG4 libraries
  must be present. It should no longer be necessary to compile the
  necessary AClick on the fly.

- Investigations on wirframe drawing:
  Wireframes are a property of the scene graph. You can toggle to wireframe
  using the 'w' key on the keyboard. Other representations are 
  'r': Solid view
  't': Solid + wireframe view.
  This information is accessible from the help menu of the ROOT OGL widget.

# v00-07
* 2014/05/28 Markus Frank

- Several fixes and improvements in DDG4
  - Cache output levels in Geant4Kernel object
  - Add shell handler to measure energy escape e.g. in calorimeters
- Fix bug in Polycone shapes concerning angles.
      **IMPORTANT: If you forked the repository examples/CLICSiD
      your PolyconeSupport does not work anymore, because the angles
      were given in degrees. They should be given in radians!**

* 2014/05/21 Markus Frank
- Fix material creation from XML
    JIRA bug: dd4hep -  DDFORHEP-4
    https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/DDFORHEP-4
    using <composite> in material xml files results in wrong material properties

- Fix JIRA bug: dd4hep -   DDFORHEP-3
    https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/DDFORHEP-3
   Recursive assemblies result in error in TGeo geometry
    Bug results in errors when closing the geometry like:
    "Error in <TGeoVoxelFinder::SortAll>: Wrong bounding box for volume SIT_assembly"

- Provision to store survey constants to the DetElement as an extension
    for Alignment calculations (priv. comm. C.Parkes)

- Fix bug in expression evaluation of angles.
    All detector constructors receive angles in "rad". No correction 
    from degree to rad should be necessary.

* 2014/05/21 Frank Gaede
- add MaterialManager class providing
  - access to materials at any point or on straight
    line between two points
  - creation of material with averaged properties (A,Z,rho,x0,Lambda)
 
- added utility print_materials to print material properties along  
  a straight line between two points including integrated radiation and 
  interaction lengths (useful for debugging geometries and materials)
 
- use avaeraged material for Surfaces where the thickness extends
  beyond the volume boundaries
   - introduced new simple data class MaterialData for this       
    

- known issues
   - materials don't work for detectors with assemblies in assemblies
        as the TGeo navigation dose not seem to work:
	Error in <TGeoVoxelFinder::SortAll>: Wrong bounding box for volume SIT_assembly
        -> ROOT bug or feature ?

    - using <composite/> in compound materials results in incorrect material properties
       see ILDExDet/compact/materials Polysterene as example


* 2014/05/06 Frank Gaede
- DDSurfaces/DDRec:
  - added ICylinder and CylinderSurface to provide
    access to cylinder radius for the tracking
- teveDisplay: 
  - draw sensitive surfaces in red and helper surfaces in gray
  - protect against missing lcio input file
  - reduced printout from VolumeManager  (changed INFO to DEBUG)

* 2014/04/05-2014/04/29 Frank Gaede
- Implementation of Surface classes for track reconstruction
  - abstract interfaces in DDSurface:  ISurface and IMaterial  
  - implementation in DDRec:  Surface, SurfaceManager, DetectorSurfaces
  - basic functionality exists:
  - meassurement surface vectors u,v, normal and origin
  - check if point is inside the bounds of the corresponding volume
  - currently the material is taken to be the one from the volume 
      -> to do: average material if surface thicknesses extend beyond the
                volume for comound materials
  - added drawing of surfaces and (Sim)TrackerHits and (Sim)CalorimeterHits to teveDisplay
     ( link lcio file to teve_infile.slcio )
  - added some surfaces to ILDExDet: VXD, SIT, TPC
  - added test_surfaces to ILDExSimu
     (fails currently for some hits that are not created on the surface ...)
  - added some assemblies to ILDExDet to better structure the geometry hierarchy   

* 2014/04/28  Markus Frank
- First attempt to understand fully the handling of recursive assemblies
     from the 2014/04/25 was apparently with limited success. Now they should
     work!

* 2014/04/25  Markus Frank
- Moved boost::spirit parsers to DDCore, since these parsers are also used
     in other packages such as DDCond and DDAlign - whenever strings have to be
     converted to objects.
     Consequently, the boost spirit code fragments were removed from DDG4.
- Improved and more correct type checking when assigning handles
- Explicit implementation of the object extension mechanism to be used 
     through inheritance or aggregation rather than having seperate and nearly
     identical implementations for various objects.
- Improved defintition of basic objects describing Conditions and Alignment.
- Improved implementation of DDAlign, the alignment support.
     Not to be used currently - experimental package.
- Initial implementation of DDCond the package supporting the handling of 
     conditions.
     Not to be used currently - experimental package.
- Geant4Converter: I convinced myself, that the bug in handling assemblies
     of assemblies is resolved. To be tested though.

* 2014/02/07  Frank Gaede
- added DDGear, support for interfacing to gear for backward compatibility
  - lives currently in ILDExDet ( should become (optional) part of core dd4hep)
  - users need to GearParameter objects as extensions to the DetElement
       -> see ILDExTPC_geo.cpp, ILDExVXD_geo.cpp, ILDExTPCSIT_geo.cpp as examples
  - program convertToGear creates gear xml file from compact file 
       ( only if  GearParameter objects are avialble as extensions)
  - added test_convert_ild_gear 
- fixed  geometry in ILDExVXD_geo.cpp, ILDExTPCSIT_geo.cpp
     wrt. to position of support ans sensitive ladders

# v00-06   
* 2014/02/04  Frank Gaede
- fixed environment scripts thisdd4hep.sh and this${PackageName}.sh
    to also export library pathes for external libraries (CLHEP, LCIO, gear)

- added some simple tests to ILDExDet, ILDExSimu and noviceN04
  - provide cmake script run_test_package.sh ( configured as run_test_${PackageName} ) 
      to call test binaries after initializing the environment
      (needed for automated/nightly tests)

- updated Readme.txt wrt build procedure and running the tests


* 2014/01/17    Markus Frank
- Prepare implementation of Alignment using Release and Grap features of TGeoVolume
    and TGeoNode. In principle this was done in a backwards compatible way, but 
    I cannot really check 100% the #ifdef's.
- Fix handling of XML collections using XercesC.
    (Bug reported by P.Kostka).
- Fix several compiler warnings issued by Coverity.

* 2013/12/17    Markus Frank
- Whole load of fixes to keep coverity quiet....
- Fix bug in DDG4 field interface component
- Allow the usage of units, positions and lorentzvectors and in DDG4 properties.
    Example using a position property (ROOT::Math::XYZVector):
    Idle> /ddg4/Gun/position (1*mm,1*cm,0.01*m) 
    Geant4UIMessenger: +++ Gun> Setting property value position = (1*mm,1*cm,0.01*m)  
                       native:( 1 , 10 , 10 ).

- Support for std::vector<T>/std::list<T>/std::set<T> properties.

  - Support for include directives of the format
```
        <include ref="file-name"/>
    for the top level <lccdd> tags
       Parent tag    Included root tag  Data content
    -- <lccdd>       <define>           See below.
                     <detectors>
		     <detector>
		     <display>
		     <lccdd>            Nested includes (with DTD validation for Xerces-C)
    -- <define>      <define>           Set of constants
    -- <detectors>   <detector>         Single XML subdetector description
    -- <detectors>   <detectors>        Multiple XML subdetector descriptions
    -- <display>     <display>          Set ov visualization attributes

    DTD validation is only performed using Xerces-C for root tags <lccdd>.
```
- Note: 
    `<lccdd>` include directives are executed BEFORE any other directive!
    Other include directives are executed BEFORE the corresponding named directive!

* 2013/11/14    Markus Frank
- Reformat files in DDCode and DDG4 to remove the <TAB>s from the source files.
    Hopefully the content is now more readable.
- DDCore: Remove empty and named constructors for shapes. Empty constructors
    were simply a dangerous hook to memory leaks, named constructors are 
    deprecated since along time.
- DDG4: add support for messengers to access and modify properties from
    the Geant4 prompt. For the test hit classes and the simple sensitive 
    detector a ROOT I/O plugin was provided.
- DDG4: Split into several libraries:
  - libDDG4.so pure    link library without any plugins
  - libDDG4Legacy.so   'Old' plugins. The old stuff at some point
                               will have to disappear.
  - libDDG4Plugins.so  New framework plugins
  - libDDG4LCIO.so     LCIO output plugin for new framework

* 2013/11/03    Markus Frank
- doc: Add CHEP2013 paper about dd4hep as a start of the documentation 
    section. More to come hopefully.
- DDCore: several small improvements:
  - Segmentations are no longer Ref_t's.
  - Base internal implementing object directly on the segmentations 
      classes from Christian.
  - Rearrangement of some code from Handle.h to Primitives.h
  - Allow to attach extensions to Detector
- DDG4: Fix Frank's simulation problem, which he caused himself
    introducing his famous factories....
- DDG4: First attempt to fix simulation problem with mignetic field.
    Ready for testing.
- DDG4: First commit of a independent simulation aimed for LHCb and LHeC
    + other newcomers. Documentation needs to be written.
    Features:
  - Modular setup of all Geant4 action routines as plugins, including the
      Run-, event-, tracking-, stacking-, stepping- and generator-actions 
      as well as the physics lists with particle and physics constructors.
  - Setup is possible in XML or with C++ either as an AClick in root or
      standalone. Python based starter to come.
  - Missing is a modular description of the G4 UI and VIS manager(s).
  - Documentation is to come. Before documentation is not present
      the usage is discouraged.
    Note:
  - This version of DDG4 uses boost::spirit. It will compile without
      the BOOST include files and the old functionality is preserved, 
      but it will not work.
      To use BOOST add to the cmake statement the following tags:
      cmake <regular tags> \
      -DDD4HEP_USE_BOOST=ON \
      -DBOOST_INCLUDE_DIR=${BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR}  ....
      Where BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR should point to the boost header directory.
      BOOST libraries are not used.

* 2013/10/18    Markus Frank
- Throw exception if the expression evaluator sees a problem.
    The message printed before was often not seen.
- Improve printout on exceptions and plugin abortion
- Remove the typedef RotationZYX -> Rotation and
    import the type RotationZYX from ROOT::Math.

- Add more explicit error messages in case a plugin is not found.
- Add file TGeoUnits.h, which allows to use the "usual SystemOfUnits"
    from CLHEP using TGeo with the namespace tgeo::xxx
```
    Example: tgeo::mm -> 0.1 (Geant3: cm, sec,  GeV, degree)
                 ::mm -> 1.0 (Geant4: mm, nsec, MeV, radian)
    I hope I got all translations right.
    Geant4                                   Geant3
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    millimeter         mm=1,cm=10            centimeter  mm=0.1,cm=1
    nanosecond         s=1e9                 second      ns=1e-9,s=1
    Mega electron Volt GeV=1e3               GeV         GeV=1
    radian             rad=1                 degree      rad=180/pi

    Unclear to me was if in Geant3 steradian is also 2*2*pi or 2*2*180 degree.
```


* F. Gaede
- changes to build system:
         (see ReadMe.txt for details)

- moved examples to ./example directory   
- they are not built as part of dd4hep anymore

- install thisdd4hep.sh in ./bin
           (modified to have the correct pathes) 

- added -DINSTALL_DOC=on/off option
           to build doxygen documentation (in ./doc/html/index.html)

- create DD4hepConfig.cmake for easy building against dd4hep
           ( see examples CMakeLists.txt)

- fixed doxygen API documentation (C.Rosemann)
          (greatly improved with many graphs)

# v00-04
* F. Gaede
- placement options are now compatible with geant4 
- fixed Geant4SensitiveDetector::getVolumeID()
- modified ILDEx model to not use assemblies (for now !?)
- removed obsolete geant4 example ILDEx
- Fix population procedure of volume manager
- Fix uniqueness of volume identifiers.
- Remove call with lookups by placed volume to the volume manager
- improved ILDEx toy example:	   		
  - fixed creation of cellIDS for simhits
  - creates SimTrackerHits for VXD, SIT and TPC
    - creates SimCalorimeterHits for AHcal barrele and endcap
    - works now wigth ILDExSimu _and_ SLIC if no assemblies are used
    - assemblies work with the dd4hep Geant4Converter and VolumeManager
  - added a prototype example for a ROOT independent 
              plugin mechanism for SensitiveDetectors
  - added example implemetation for Calice test beam
          calorimeters: CaliceTbeam  (Shaojun Lu, DESY)


* 2013/21/06    Markus Frank
- Since the placement model for combined translations and rotations
      caused more confusion than good, it was agreed to move to a more
      Geant4 like placement model using Vectors, Rotations and Transformations
      from ROOT::Math. To place a physical volume only one of these
      is allowed as an argument: either a rotation or a translation
      for simple placements. Combinations may be constructed with Transform3D
      objects allowing more complicated placements.
      The same mechanism was applied for the operations to construct
      boolean solids.
- The CLICSid Examples were updated according to the changes necessary
      from 1)
- The Tesla drivers from the ILDExDet example were removed. They are
      not compliant to 1).
- The G4 package allows now to translate TGeo geometries to Geant4.
      Visual inspection has shown an agreement between the two geometries.
- The TGeo to Detector/GDML conversion is still buggy. Hence, simulations
      using slic as an engine do not yet work. This is being looked at.

   IMPORTANT NOTICE:
   The changes described in above may affect existing detector constructors.
   Unless all problems are solved you should be careful to move to the svn
   head. In any case save your checkout or use the tag v00-03.

 

# v00-03
- broken geometry (for some rotations/translations)
- 'backup release' before placement options 
   will be reduced

# v00-02
* 2013/02/06    Markus Frank
- Simplyfy inheritance for common objects from TNamed.
     Use direct inheritance of Object from TNamed rather than hidden 
     using the Value<a,b> construct.
- Added physical volume manager to simplyfy the detector element 
     and sensitive detector lookup from a given physical volume.
     This implies: If the volume manager is instantiated, the readout specifiers
     MUST be correct. This is in most xml files NOT the case.
     The "system" field holding the sibdetector-id is MANDATORY!
     Otherwise you will receive messages like this:

     Exception:SITCollection: This ID descriptor has no field with the name:CellID0
               while programming VolumeManager. Are your volIDs correct?

- To check the volume identification, add argument -volmgr to geoConverter,
     geoDisplay, etc.
- To trace possible memory leaks:
     export DD4HEP_TRACE=Yes
     then run you converter etc. At the end a table is displayed with a "leakage"
     column, showing how many objects were not deleted.

     Ideally the second column only has "0"s. Instances of 1 may be OK (singletons).
```
- Prenotice:
     As soon as ROOT v 6.00 is out, we will have to use it!
     Andrei kindly agreed to implement a few changes to TGeo, which will make 
     life much easier and the implementation cleaner and less cumbersome.


# v00-01

- Finished the compact->description converter
     Extract description information
```
      $ > geoConverter -compact2description -input file:<compact-input-xml-file> -output <detector>.description
      $ > <SimDist>/scripts/slic.sh -o output.slcio -g SiD.description -m <geant4-macro>.mac -r 100 
```

- Finished the compact->gdml converter
  Full GDML cycle can be tested (deplace <detector> with some meaningful identifier):
  - Extract gdml information
      `$ > geoConverter -compact2gdml -input file:<compact-input-xml-file> -output <detector>.gdml`
  - Extract visualisation hints to csv file
      `$ > geoConverter -compact2vis -input file:<compact-input-xml-file> -output <detector>.vis.csv -ascii`
  - Load GDML into ROOT:
      `$ > root.exe ../doc/gdml_root.C+\(\"<detector>\"\)`
      The macro expects *at least* the <detector>.gdml file. If no visualisation
      information is found, the resulting graphics however is not very nice!

- Today a decision was taken to remove all _X() and _A() macros 
  accessing static unicode strings. A common macro will be used to
  address both XML elements and XML attributes using the macro _U(...).
  The original usage only created confusion.
  All _X and _A macros were replaced by _U.

- Improve the executables running the plugin mechanism in UtitlityApps.
  They now complain if the plugin was not found.

- Require strict checks for the existence of xml attributes.
  e.g. default=false for Element::attr<bool>() is no longer an option.
  if the attribute is not present in the element, an exception
  is thrown.

- Slightly change the factory method for creating detector elements.
  Use a more generic pattern do support also more generic XML 
  processing.

* 2013/20/02    Markus Frank
- Install rootmap mechanism for the usage of plugins.
  It is no longer necessary to have separate programs
  for the various detector models (ILD/SiD).
  One generic display program servest them all.
  ==> Creation of package DDExamples/UtilityApps
  example: $> bin/displayGeo -compact <compact-xml-file>

- This move has another consequence:
  All libraries are build into a common install area:
  the <build directory>/lib.
  All executable binaries are build into a common install area:
  the <build directory>/bin.

- The LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH variables as defined in 
  'thisdd4hep.(c)sh' do include these directories

- dd4hep release notes. Better start them late than never.
  If you perform significant changes to the dd4hep core,
  plase leave a small notice here.
