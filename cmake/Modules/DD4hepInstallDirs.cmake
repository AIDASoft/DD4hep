# Copied from geant4/cmake/Modules
#
# - Define standard installation directories for Geant4
# Provides install directory variables as defined for GNU software:
#  http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html
# Inclusion of this module defines the following variables:
#  CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>      - destination for files of a given type
#  CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir> - corresponding absolute path
# where <dir> is one of:
#  BINDIR           - user executables (bin)
#  LIBDIR           - object code libraries (lib or lib64)
#  INCLUDEDIR       - C header files (include)
#  DATAROOTDIR      - read-only architecture-independent data root (share)
#  DATADIR          - read-only architecture-independent data (DATAROOTDIR)
#  MANDIR           - man documentation (DATAROOTDIR/man)
#  DOCDIR           - documentation root (DATAROOTDIR/doc/PROJECT_NAME)
# Each CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir> value may be passed to the DESTINATION options 
# of install() commands for the corresponding file type. If the includer 
# does not define a value the above-shown default will be used and the 
# value will appear in the cache for editing by the user.
# If any of these values are absolute paths, the install of Geant4 is 
# regarded as non-relocatable, and the variable:
#  CMAKE_INSTALL_IS_NONRELOCATABLE
# will be set.
# Each CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir> value contains an absolute path constructed
# from the corresponding destination by prepending (if necessary) the value
# of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
